Tried to get as many legitimate credible IT sources and courses on Udemy as possible before applying for my first IT job. Although interested mainly in RPA and AI, in my current state
I know I am not ready for a full-on job or even internship yet in my desired field. As such, I want to delve into the other types of software OR hardware side of things and start wherever I can, 
to gain some expertise on providing IT tech support. I have always wondered how my school's laptops were configured (whenever I was locked out and had to reset my password / why I need to change my password
to something of similar length and pattern as the pre-set one) and how WiFi, ports, printers worked and how to set up / fix them in future if I needed to.

Some important notes:
<!-- 4 pillars of Good Design - 1. Color Theory, 2. Typography, 3.UI, 4.UX
Color Theory - mood to predominant color (Red:Love, Energy, Intensity|Yellow:Joy, Intellect, Attention|Green:Freshness, Safety, Growth|Blue:Stability, Trust, Serenity|Purple:Royalty, Wealth, Femininity)
                          Egs.   Car                          Workout                         Food                            Paypal, Coinbase                Payday Loans
               secondary color: color diff shade of predominant color to create analogous color palette (navigation bars, body, logo & background) +:eye-soothing -:doesn't stand out
                            OR  color directly opp of predominant color to create complementary/clashing color palette +: stands out, -:very jarring on eg. text & text bg
Typography - (PHOTO)
             Serif(WRITE WITH FEET) subfamily: Old Style(winery), Transitional, Modern(VOGUE) (can tell the age & HENCE target audience by the diff b/w thickest and thinnest parts of the same letter. old->modern less diff->more diff Eg. O, O, O)
      VS     Sans-Serif subfamily (highly legible (PHOTOS)(for body text): Grotesque, Humanist, Geometric
UI - Perception Hierarchy via colors, size, weight, layout (eg. 40-60 chars per line for non-tedious, non-choppy+awkward to read),
                              alignment (draw a line going thru beginning of each item - TICK less lines), white space (minimalistic, isolate prdt & inject exclusivity, impt), target audience
UX - 1. Simplicity 2.Consistency(navbar) 3.Reading Patterns(F pattern 1->2 then -DOWNARROW3 then ->4 generally, Z pattern for more sparse, more img/vid content)
     4.Responsiveness 5.X Dark Patterns (Trickery to get ppl to do sth they didn't mean/want to) Eg. Shopee, Amazon auto selecting express delivery & making it stand out to profit/Curved line as a hair on mobile to click on website & profit/Purposely confusing checkboxes for email newsletter, etc -->

I've completed "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" course from Udemy.
One of my first forays into computer science - I chose to take this course, hoping it would provide more structure and better
guidance (a curriculum, more like) than I was getting "self-learning".

While taking part in this course, I have been writing notes and what-not and attempting all of the course projects to the
best of my abilities.

I'll be using this repo as reference for my future self as and when I need them.
Really recommend this course. Managed to finish in around 2 months, excluding the "Professional" projects which required way more
in-depth, independent research, since they weren't covered much in detail / I felt unprepared to tackle them until I gained more 
knowledge and practice from other Udemy courses (Thanks, Udemy! <3)

P.S: Some days are missing, because they are either 1. simply lectures/not-that-worthy projects to show off what I've taken away
2. broken into parts and I uploaded the latest part, or 3. skipped due to it being about GUI (a little birdie told me GUIs are better implemented and displayed using say, JavaScript instead)

Problem: cannot hover to load on-hover data, so cannot add genres which shows 6 tags
Solution: 1. couldn't hover cos window was not maximised üòÖ, 2. ActionsChains for hover,  3. Explicit wait vs time.sleep for extracting info on hover when normally "hidden"
(from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait + from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC)

Extremely proud of this project
Learnt logging (how useful!), TG Bot's (ConversationHandler, ReplyKeyboard/InlineKeyboard, more purposeful and necessary documentation (docstrings, parameter&return types, comments), selenium's headless (& faster) mode
Proper OOP style,  numbing formatting annoying data

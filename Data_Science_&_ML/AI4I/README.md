Levels of Human Involvement: Human-in-the-loop, Human-over-the-loop, Human-out-of-the-loop
                             --> ⬆️ use, risk of AI harm
Human-in-the-loop: Human must take affirmative action, AI only provides recommendations
Human-over-the-loop: Human able to monitor all decisions, Human override is easy, AI makes decisions
Human-out-of-the-loop: Human cannot easily override, AI takes full control
```
- Data Assessment: What/How/When data collected, what is missed out/over-represented? Eg. Biased data creates biased models
- De-identify data (mask/delete fields like name, address, etc), Restrict data access

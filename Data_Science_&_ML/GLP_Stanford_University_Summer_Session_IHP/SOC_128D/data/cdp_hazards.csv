Impactos esses que podem ser cruciais para a operação de usinas hidrelétricas instaladas (FEARNSIDE, 2012). Como a região é coberta em grande parte por florestas, do ponto de vista socioeconômico, espera-se um menor impacto relacionado às Secas. Porém, como essas áreas são ricas em biodiversidade e recursos naturais,  populações tradicionais dependem do equilíbrio climático atual para sua subsistência, devendo-se assim dar especial atenção ao desmatamento, ao rompimento da resiliência e da capacidade de suporte das populações tradicionais aí residentes.

Impactos esses que podem ser cruciais para a operação de usinas hidrelétricas instaladas (FEARNSIDE, 2012). Como a região é coberta em grande parte por florestas, do ponto de vista socioeconômico, espera-se um menor impacto relacionado às Secas. Porém, como essas áreas são ricas em biodiversidade e recursos naturais,  populações tradicionais dependem do equilíbrio climático atual para sua subsistência, devendo-se assim dar especial atenção ao desmatamento, ao rompimento da resiliência e da capacidade de suporte das populações tradicionais aí residentes.

Impactos esses que podem ser cruciais para a operação de usinas hidrelétricas instaladas (FEARNSIDE, 2012). Como a região é coberta em grande parte por florestas, do ponto de vista socioeconômico, espera-se um menor impacto relacionado às Secas. Porém, como essas áreas são ricas em biodiversidade e recursos naturais,  populações tradicionais dependem do equilíbrio climático atual para sua subsistência, devendo-se assim dar especial atenção ao desmatamento, ao rompimento da resiliência e da capacidade de suporte das populações tradicionais aí residentes.

Impactos esses que podem ser cruciais para a operação de usinas hidrelétricas instaladas (FEARNSIDE, 2012). Como a região é coberta em grande parte por florestas, do ponto de vista socioeconômico, espera-se um menor impacto relacionado às Secas. Porém, como essas áreas são ricas em biodiversidade e recursos naturais,  populações tradicionais dependem do equilíbrio climático atual para sua subsistência, devendo-se assim dar especial atenção ao desmatamento, ao rompimento da resiliência e da capacidade de suporte das populações tradicionais aí residentes.

Impactos esses que podem ser cruciais para a operação de usinas hidrelétricas instaladas (FEARNSIDE, 2012). Como a região é coberta em grande parte por florestas, do ponto de vista socioeconômico, espera-se um menor impacto relacionado às Secas. Porém, como essas áreas são ricas em biodiversidade e recursos naturais,  populações tradicionais dependem do equilíbrio climático atual para sua subsistência, devendo-se assim dar especial atenção ao desmatamento, ao rompimento da resiliência e da capacidade de suporte das populações tradicionais aí residentes.

Impactos esses que podem ser cruciais para a operação de usinas hidrelétricas instaladas (FEARNSIDE, 2012). Como a região é coberta em grande parte por florestas, do ponto de vista socioeconômico, espera-se um menor impacto relacionado às Secas. Porém, como essas áreas são ricas em biodiversidade e recursos naturais,  populações tradicionais dependem do equilíbrio climático atual para sua subsistência, devendo-se assim dar especial atenção ao desmatamento, ao rompimento da resiliência e da capacidade de suporte das populações tradicionais aí residentes.

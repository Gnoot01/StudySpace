Hope this doesnt get deleted because of irrelevancy. 

You all dont know me really but my name is Velvet and I once made a video called [Super Best Friends Played](https://youtu.be/mUSIhMu8G1s). A video saying goodbye to our best friends, and how the legacy lives on in the subreddit. 

Four years and some months ago I made this Reddit account to start the path to make that video. I wanted one that was named after the channel that I wanted to create as well. Ive been using Reddit since 2011, but with the recent changes to the API, my time is at an end I think. 

Since 2018 Ive used Apollo as my main way to interact with Reddit. Since other apps were not great, I loved the creator and his attitude towards the apps development, and was everything I wanted; A direct way to access the subreddits I loved without ads with plenty of posting tools. 

In 2020, I gave up on social media basically. I couldnt tell you the last time I logged into twitter, I dont even have the app on my phone. I apparently lost my Facebook but, oh well, suck it Zuck. 

I never thought Id lose reddit though. Now looks like I am. I could use old.reddit but still the ads and even then who knows how much longer thatll last. Reddit has shown a clear disregard for 3rd Party Apps. Disregard to those who develop them, and those who need them (the blind/hard of seeing community especially). And really as much as it sucks to lose the connection to you all especially, your memes and threads have all been so much fun to read during work and on the toilet. I try my best to not support those that are problematic. 

While I understand its impossible to cut out everything problematic, and even then it might not do anything, itll at least make me feel okay with myself. Its not about others and is right to me. In the same way I sometimes walk to the store, though I have a car, I think of the climate and just that this is helping some what and its the right thing to do. Or I buy a candy bar and I think of the labor conditions one must have gone through to get me it, I shouldnt do this but just this little bit this one time. Or the person I love begging me to play Diablo 4 with them even. 

Not using Reddit, while itll destroy my connection to all you wonderful people, will feel like the right thing to do. Though it may make me feel a little lonely, its the right thing. 

Why this post? Well. I guess its because I want to say goodbye and thank you. Just like in my video I suppose. Come June 30th, when Apollo sunsets, I will lose connection to you all. Thatll be that. Even if Reddit backpedals on everything, itll still probably be out for me. As then itd be trying to find a Reddit app that doesnt suck, filters the ads, and still allows me to comment. But judging by the tone in the air, it doesnt seem that way. 

Goodbye and take care of each other. Thank you all for all your posts and threads. Thank you for all your help on my project. Thank you for keeping on being the Best Friends when the Best Friends left. 

Watch the last post I see be a fucking Evilak meme.. swear to god..

Brussels plans to lift controls on some genetically modified crops to help farmers cope with climate change in a move likely to reignite a Europe-wide debate about the controversial techniques.

A draft EU regulation seen by the Financial Times proposes that many modified plants should be approved as conventional rather than go through the blocs existing GMO regime, which is laborious and expensive.

The plan would establish a category of plants that have used gene editing to create new varieties but could have been achieved through traditional breeding techniques. They include wheat that can withstand drought, tomatoes resistant to fungus and potatoes containing less acrylamide, which becomes carcinogenic when fried.

EU officials say the new techniques are vital to maintain crop yields as farmers contend with changing weather patterns, such as drought and floods. They would also reduce the use of pesticides, fertilisers and other chemicals. The proposal could still be changed before being put forward by the European Commission on July 5.

The science and the evidence show that these can be achieved also through conventional breeding of crops, said an EU official.

The economic rationale is very strong. If we want to cope with climate change and support food security we need these techniques.

The proposal sets out different regulatory options but favours a light-touch regime for most new plant varieties  which would be treated similarly to conventional plants and would not require authorisation, risk assessment, traceability and labelling as GMOs. A transparency register would be established for these plants, according to the draft.

Gene editing is a form of engineering in which genes can be deleted or added from the same or similar species, accelerating a traditional process where scientists blend different species of plant. An example would be splicing a variety of wheat with a large ear, leading to high yields, with one with a thick stem, making it more resistant to wind.<a0>

It is distinct from genetic modification, which introduces DNA from foreign species.

Plants using gene editing that could not arise naturally would require full GMO authorisation. However, measures would be introduced to incentivise plant products that could contribute to a sustainable agri-food system, and crops judged as such would not have to carry a GMO label.<a0>

Only a handful of GMOs have been authorised in the EU, mainly to feed animals, because of public and political opposition to so-called Frankenfoods.<a0>

Greenpeace said it would oppose any relaxation and described the proposal as coming from an unscientific fantasy world where corporations unproven claims of benefits are taken for granted and risks dont exist.

Eva Corral, Greenpeace EU GMO campaigner, said the unions senior judges in 2018 had ruled that gene editing should be covered by the GMO regulation.

The EUs top court was clear that GMOs by another name are still GMOs. The EU must keep new GMOs regulated to make sure they pose no danger for nature, pollinators or human health.",neoliberal,387,387,0,0.99,0,0,0,54

Ukraines President [is warning](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/14fym23/we_have_just_had_a_report_from_our_intelligence/) about a **potential Russian terror attack on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant**, if you believe him. The purported scenario is [a radiation leak](https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-russia-considers-radiological-terrorist-attack-at-zaporizhzhia-plant/), though [Russia denies this](https://archive.ph/s0CQ0). The **Khakovka reservoir is** [**already drying up**](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65963403) after the Dam was destroyed on June 6, leaving less water available to cool the nuclear power plant, Europes largest.

Ukraines top general claims that [**their counteroffensive is just beginning**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/23/everything-is-still-ahead-inside-a-secret-military-base-with-top-ukraine-general) and the best is yet to come. For now, [small gains](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60506682) are being made by both sides in contested zones; the Wagner chief claimed [Russian soldiers are retreating](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/06/23/ukraine-russia-war-latest-news-putin-crimea-kherson/). Reports from the UN say [Russia is using children as human shields](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/22/ukraine-war-live-updates-latest-news-on-russia-and-the-war-in-ukraine.html). Two grain ships left Ukraines ports for Spain. 

The head of the Wagner Group, **Yevgeny Prigozhin**, [**began a mutiny**](https://archive.ph/Q3bgf) against the Russian ~~Ministry of Defense~~ Federation, commanding his troops to advance upon Moscow in a march of justice, allegedly to force the retirement of several Russian generals. His forces, about 25,000 in total, occupied Rostov-on-Don before advancing north. [Criminal charges were filed](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66005256) against Prigozhin for starting an armed rebellion. But then, suddenly, an agreement was reached that gave immunity to Prigozhin [and the Wagner soldiers](https://news.sky.com/story/russia-rebellion-wagner-troops-to-be-absorbed-into-russian-military-as-prigozhin-heads-to-belarus-12909128). This [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/WagnerVsRussia/comments/14i3enl/timeline_of_events_in_russia_over_the_last_24_hrs/) gives a detailed timeline of the events. The damage to Russia is nevertheless done: the state has been revealed to be openly brittle, with a considerable number of citizens supporting the attempted coup. Many others simply dont care who rules in Russia; **hollow patriotism and political technology has thoroughly demoralized the masses**. Will Putin learn from his mistakes from this failed coupor will Prigozhins aborted coup plot provide the springboard for the next one?

**Over 50 million people are living in modern slavery** according to the 172-page [Global Slavery Index 2023](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/global-slavery-index-2023). The report contains data from 2021, and claims that 28M are in forced labor, 22M in forced marriages, and 12M children in some form of slaveryan increase of 10M from the previous report, which was issued in 2018. (Ive been wondering lately: how many people do you think actually look at these kinds of reports?)

The 10 countries with the most slaves in 2021 were, in descending order: North Korea, Eritrea, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, T<fc>rkiye, Tajikistan, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, Afghanistan, and Kuwait. The report indicates that **slavery will increase** in the coming years, since climate change and War will destabilize regions more. **Human trafficking, sexual violence, discrimination, corporate abuse, and child soldiers** will become more frequent.

I originally posted about hitting $3.2M ([post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/n2bdsn/just_hit_32m_in_net_worth_today/)) and it blew up back then.

2 years have passed since my last major update and Ive received a number of requests for updates - so I figure why not?

Back in early/mid 2021 I reached $3.2M in net worth. Now - even with all the craziness of the past couple years - Ive hit $6M.

In many ways, this is perhaps an observation of what happens the first two years after you hit the first two years of wealth - as I think it takes that much time to start to adjust to your life a little bit. I wrote a little more about work than other areas because it's been such a crazy two years in tech - but amidst all the noise, the signal of my FATFIRE plans remains essentially the same. : )

Anyway, thanks for bearing with me - it was actually deeply cathartic / therapeutic to write this all down. Here we go! : )

&amp;#x200B;

** WORK **

\* I work in tech, and like many of us who do - its been a rough couple of years. Our share price debuted at $40, shot up to $200 by end-2021 and then in 2022 crashed to as low as $10.  Its rebalanced at the moment at the $50-60 range, which I will take. To be honest, $200 was never real - just irrational exuberance - but neither was $10. But its meant a lot of volatility in wealth and our Board is breathing down our necks a bit. (And in case anyone was wondering - because of insider trading restrictions I couldnt take advantage of the $200 prices lol.)

\* Beyond the volatility in share prices, the fundamentals of the business remain strong but also have seen some fallout. Some of our revenue growth acceleration benefited via a 1-off boost from the pandemic and also from the blockchain / crypto hype wave at the same time. When those eased off, our revenue growth slowed.

\* Like many in the industry, we went through our own wave of layoffs. We just did 1 big layoff (20%+) so wed hopefully never have to repeat it again. I was part of the planning of the layoff and it was a pretty miserable 3 months. I had to choose who to layoff. I couldnt talk about it with anyone on my team and had to keep up pretenses until we conducted the RIF. I had to conduct the layoffs for 12 people myself. And I had to pick up the pieces and hold the remaining team together and get us through it all. Its been almost 6 months post-RIF for us, and were mostly back to normal. I just wish we had a little more joy and a little less fear these days, but I think joy is hard to find in tech these days.

\* As an aside for those wondering about the layoffs, these things are never perfect - and never executed perfectly. We let everyone know via email in the early hours in the morning and deactivated their access to our systems immediately afterwards, which might seem cold. But given the scale and risk to customer data, there was no easy way to do it. We also tried very hard to be as generous as possible. We gave everyone impacted generous packages of 7 months severance with medical (we paid the individual contribution for COBRA). I followed up with everyone I personally chose for the layoff - and we offered them a chance to talk it through with me (to provide closure). About 80% did over time (and I would never force it) - 1 was irrationally angry, 1 cried and was super sad, but most were calm and understood. I also offered to personally help everyone who wanted it to get their next job, and have helped several of them. It was a hard time - and it SHOULD be hard. These are peoples lives and I feel that those who make these kinds of decisions should never be too divorced from the consequences of their decisions. It is very appropriate that I be exposed to someone who needs to scream and get angry because of a decision that I made. I probably write about this because it still weighs on me.

\* Personally, Ive done OK through it all. I run one of the parts of our business that works well and actually got promoted to in 2022, so Im seen as a bellwether for stability right now - although Im conscious that todays stability is tomorrows stagnation lol.  Weve also seen major changes in our leadership  35-40% of the C-suite and VP layer is gone, including my own C-suite leader. Ive only been here for 3 years, but Im now the 4th most tenured VP in the company (out of 25 VPs) and also ranked #9 out of 1200 employees - I find the attention and pressure a little uncomfortable lol. I get along with my new boss - although I miss my old one.

\* I think I have another year left in me - when I hit my 4 years of service (and my original grants vest), Ill start to arrange for a thoughtful transition. RIght now, I need to do my part to keep things stable and create a new upward path - not just for the company but also for my team.

** HOME **

\* In my last post, I wrote about wanting to upgrade from my 1.5 bedroom apartment to a single-family home here in San Francisco. So&. I did it! Probably the biggest flex Ill ever do.

\* In late 2021, I bought a 3br, 3bath house with a beautiful garden in the Potrero HIll neighborhood of San Francisco for $2.5M. The market was very hot then, so I know I slightly overpaid for it, but also locked down a great interest rate 2.7% fixed rate.

\* The house is a source of continuing joy for me : ). I have coffee in my garden, cook in my French farmhouse kitchen, etc. Its been pricey but completely worth it for me, and I think I can afford it. Since I work from home, I spend a lot of time here and having a good home environment is important to me.\* Its admittedly a lot of house for a single guy and a cat lol. But its at least partially a promise to myself for the life that I want to have in the future. Its a house thats meant to be filled with people and life and love and laughter, and I'm committing myself to making that happen. : )

\* I also sold my old apartment shortly afterwards. I broke even on the apartment - but I didnt want so much SF real estate in my books and I was nervous about rising mortgage rates killing the market for SF apartments. (I sold just before the first rate hike.) There were also covenants / restrictions about renting in that building (they restricted the # of apartments that could be rented at any one time) - so selling was the only real option.

\* Do I regret selling the apartment and not making a profit? Maybe a little, but not too much. I dont view my real estate transactions as just financial investments - theyre also places for me to live and be. And also, Im not looking to real estate as my major source of wealth generation at the moment - my net worth rose from $3.2M to $6M in this period, so I wont sweat the small stuff. Im generally a satisficer and not an optimizer at these things - but I readily admit to not being a real estate mogul in the making lol.

** PERSONAL **

\* Still very very single lol. Dating around but nothing serious. (Also, dating sucks! Cant wait to settle down&.) And yes, I will use a prenup when I do settle down.

\* My birthday gift to myself will be a hot tub for the garden lol.

\* Beyond that and the house - I still dont spend a ton on myself. For example, when flying personally, Ill still just travel premium economy (domestic and international).

\* I still support my family - my dad, my brother and my sisters - and happy to do so. Unfortunately, though, the situation with my brother became a bit complicated - Ive given him $100K over 3 years for his kids schooling, but I think its gotten to be a bit too much and I had to lay some clearer guidelines. I think its fine now, though. Wrote more about it here in the AITA forum: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13kb1uv/comment/jksfp38/?context=3

\* I joined the board of a non-profit focused on education and love it!

\* Personal fitness - its been a rough couple of years, like conducting the layoffs. Need to pick this up again.

** INVESTMENTS **

\* Share price drops have been compensated for by more shares vesting over to me over time. With the current price range, I get another $2M if I stay until April 2024. So Ill stay until then and then trigger my thoughtful transition out.

\* Broadly speaking, I feel my number is $7-8M. I feel like I can pay down my mortgage ($2M mortgage with 28 years remaining is a LOT of interest to pay, even at just 2.7%...) and live off the interest of the remaining balance of $5-6M. Post income and property tax and if I dont have mortgage payments to make, I think having $7K/month as pure disposal income is a good / comfortable lifestyle, even in a VHCOL place like SF.

\* 80% of my financial assets are still in my companys shares. Ill need to start thinking seriously about diversification soon. It just seemed like the past year was a terrible time to sell lol.

\* I like my accountants. Im not convinced about my financial advisors and will probably let them go soon.

** RETIREMENT PLANS **

\* Still planning to retire at 44 (next year).

\* I still plan on living here in SF. Its where all my friends are. And its so pretty here. Personally, talk of the end of SF is really overstated by the press (and Elon Musk). Its really just the downtown area thats been deeply impacted. But few long-term residents live downtown.

\* Major focus for my first year will be health and wellness and finding a partner to settle down with. I want my six pack abs back lol (I was a swimmer in high school lol).

\* I expect to travel a little bit. Apart from staying with friends and family, I want to just live in Seville for a month in an airbnb, then move to Florence for a month, then Istanbul for a month.

\* Afterwards, Ill settle down to a quiet life here in SF.

\* I expect to do more mission-driven work eventually. Whether its non-profit work, or things like climate-tech.

** LESSONS / OBSERVATIONS **

\* Having friends who are in the same boat as me is really helpful. I have a couple friends whove already FATFIRED - and just being able to share with them and hang out with them has been really, really good. I dont have to hold back.

\* Conversely, Ive decided to stop talking about my FATFIRE ambitions with other friends quite so much. Not because Im being obnoxious (afaik) or that it makes them jealous - but I worry that it distorts their own aspirations for their lives. I have twenty-something friends who are talking about trying to retire at 35 now  and while I think its admirable, Im unsure how realistic it is for them. TBH, I lucked into this and never explicitly planned for it - I was planning to work until my 50s or 60s. I worry that Im causing friends to think they need to keep up with the joneses in unrealistic and potentially unhealthy ways. Anyway, something Ill have to think about more.

\* One year left to grind - I can do it!

\* $5M observation / dilemma from Succession is real lol -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQTgLXl1qXI

\* Lifestyle creep happens& I try to guard against it but I do spend a lot of time looking at second homes (in Lisbon, Hawaii, etc.) and then have to scale back my ambitions lol.

\* Still not sure about financial advisors.

\* Kindness married with intelligence, humility and work ethic remains the key to my success - such as it is.",fatFIRE,380,380,0,0.92,0,0,1,177

Dear Sirs, Madams, et al. of the High Weeds &amp; Grass Program:


I am the owner and primary resident, along with my husband, at *my address.* This past week I received a violation notification from your fine board, indicating that I have unleashed an environmental public nuisance & Specifically, vegetation which has not been cut, mowed or otherwise removed that has attained a height of twelve (12) inches or more.

 

I would first like to request clarification, along with an extension on the time period youve suggested before the city comes on to my property and removes plants that are residing here quite intentionally. I feel its necessary to protest the vague distinction of vegetation that has achieved a height of twelve (12) inches or more that could only be offending a very few people in the small cul-de-sac in which I live. Virtually every other yard in my neighborhood has vegetation in the forms of trees, bushes, and other lawn ornamentation well over twelve inches, and I myself have a multitude of trees, bushes, and so forth that fall into the realm of vegetation that cannot reasonably fall under the quite specific measurement of twelve inches. I would like a list of the specific vegetation you wish for me to remove, which I think is quite a reasonable request before you demand money from me for forcing unwanted changes onto property I own and pay ever-increasing taxes on.

 

Furthermore, Id like to address the fact that I have very specific intentions for the future of my yard and property that dont include the almost constant noise pollution many of my neighbors in this same cul-de-sac produce with unnecessary and excessive use of gasoline-powered lawn tools that not only disrupt the natural habitat were lucky enough to enjoy in this still-secluded part of Marion County, but that also make this otherwise haven of nature and beauty into a constant cacophony of chainsaws, lawn mowers, edgers, and blowers. Id like to point out that my neighbors allow feral cats to wander around the neighborhooda practice that is far more disruptive in a small ecosystem like the one we enjoy here than allowing a few plants to take their natural course for a few months of the year. (I can send along a number of studies and articles about the nuisance feral cats create. Here is just one from wildlife.org: https://wildlife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Feral-Cats.pdf.)

 

Im quite happy to produce any number of scientific texts and references, in whatever form youd like, that show leaving a property alone for the first two years of ownership is the best way to learn the natural landscape with which youre working and create a productive plan for moving forward with a regenerative natural landscape that doesnt require constant upkeep and that also provides valuable ecosystem protection thats far more important than a collection of six houses having perfectly manicured lawns, at the expense of all the peace and quiet we should enjoy every day. Im sure the landscapers who offered to mow my lawn for the incredibly reasonable price of $1,085 as a first payment and then $300/ mo into perpetuity are making sure to keep selling that expectation to my neighbors, but I hope to demonstrate a different way to be in the future. After all, were already seeing effects of climate change in our state, and we all should be changing our approaches and views when it comes to the same-old ways of performing lawn care.

 

I bought my house in December of 2020. The past two summers, Ive done minimal lawn care and have observed where the sun hits the lawn at various times of day to learn where I want to plant the native plants Ive been studying in the meantime. This year, Ive been participating in No-Mow May with a large collection of people in various online communities encouraging people to stop feeling the need to constantly hack away at their lawns, wasting time and money, and also making neighborhoods worse in myriad ways with noise pollution. Id ask that a member of the High Weeds &amp; Grass Program come spend a day in my yard and witness him- or herself how much more pleasant it is to hear birds and wind and various wildlife than it is to hear constant motors running. Within the next five years, my lawn will be highly manicured and packed full of native plants in properly delineated flowerbeds, but Im not a rich enough person to do it in one fell swoop. I will work toward making improvements over this long holiday weekend, as Id planned to do anyway, but Id still like a review that explains far more specifically whats wrong with my lawn.

 

I dont expect us to be in disagreement once we have a better understanding of one anothers intentions, but Im shocked that in a city as progressive as Indianapolis and a state as conservative  as Indiana we cant appreciate both environmental truths and the importance of respecting personal property.

 

Please dont assume that every person with a bit of a messy yard is lazy or neglectful or unloving of their property. I love my house and the land I own, and even though its incredibly beautiful to me with all my vegetation over twelve inches, I am willing to bring it in line with expectations once theyre more clearly outlined. Id also like to remind the city AND my neighbors to have some grace and consideration for several factors: This is the first home my husband and I have owned. He and I lived our entire adult lives in apartments in the city before we moved hereover half our lives at this point. Lawn care hasnt been something weve had to fit into our days, and alsowe dont have years of equipment built up. We had to replace our entire HVAC in the first year of owning our home, which limited the amount weve been able to invest in tools that others take for granted. Times are difficult. Inflation is unbelievably high. Wages are low. People are struggling and suffering. I find it hard to believe that a few stray plants in my yard are causing an environmental public nuisance to anyone who doesnt need to check their priorities. No one comes and shows you how to properly care for your lawn. Theres a steep learning curve, and were still on it.

 

Please let me know what specifics you require of me. Youre welcome to come to my door (with a  properly made appointment), email me directly, or give me a call instead of sending me vague, threatening letters in the mail.

I have been living in Bangalore for more than 2 years. I have lived in all corners of India and I thought I would settle in Bangalore because of the amazing climate and I thought it was a better city overall. I think it is the most welcoming place for outsiders compared to other major Indian cities (by outsiders I mean people not speaking local language fluently)

But recently, I had the first hand experience of language prejudice with local people which changed my thinking. It made me realise that I'll always be an outsider here because my Kannada is not good. The details are not important. I also  realised how people from Assam/Chennai feel in Delhi when they are also made to feel as outsiders.I acknowledge that this thing is not specific about Bangalore, but all major Indian cities.

So, my question is : if one has a choice, should one prioritise living in one's home city provided that career opportunities are equal but the sole reason is the language prejudice but they love the city otherwise? Or am I overblowing one incident ? Can we ever come to a stage when an Indian won't have to think about these things when moving places?

I would love to hear from someone who faced similar choice.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

edit 1: some people in comments are assuming that I expect people here to know Hindi and I myself have not made an attempt to learn the local language. No, that's not the case.I have learned as much as  I could given the fact that all office communication is in English and don't get much exposure. Now, some people are comparing Bangalore to Germany. Well at-least they make it  officially clear that you have to learn some level of German. I'll be happy if Indian states start doing this. I'll get free classes sponsored by my employer and this will keep the arrogant aliens out which people assume that I'm too.People will know beforehand what is expected of them in the new land.",bangalore,350,350,0,0.83,0,0,0,268

Climate and soil scientists [are warning](https://www.euronews.com/2023/05/21/climate-experts-warn-extreme-floods-unlikely-to-solve-drought-problem-across-europe) that Europes soil wont be able to absorb as much water now, after a season of terrible drought. The **feedback loops spell disaster** for the continents ability to weather the coming drought. France [has given up](https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/05/22/we-cant-escape-the-reality-france-is-preparing-for-4c-of-warming-by-2100) aiming for just a 1.5 <b0>C temperature increase, and are **preparing for 4 <b0>C rise by 2100**. Scientists claim [we are heading for total disaster](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/current-climate-path-lead-collapse-103729759.html), but the rest of the world apparently has bigger problems.

The world is allegedly [on track for 2.7 <b0>C](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/22/global-heating-human-climate-niche) of warming, and some experts predict that about **one billion humans may be forced to migrate as a result of global warming**, sea level rise, etc. Iraq is [one such](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/05/22/world/iraq-climate-migrants/) location, and countless migrants have already fled. On Twitter, climate scientists [report seeing more hostility](https://news.yahoo.com/climate-scientists-flee-twitter-hostility-012943481.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall) and **climate denial**.

A ships [draft/draught](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(hull)) is the distance between its waterline and the bottom of its keel/hull. This determines a ships displacement; the heavier a ships cargo, the greater its draft will be. The Panama Canal [is reducing the allowed vessel draft](https://splash247.com/further-draft-restrictions-for-drought-hit-panama-canal/) because they didnt receive enough rain in the last few months and cannot fully fill the Canals locks. As a result, more ships will be forced to make the long journey around [Cape Horn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Horn)or load up with less cargo to transit the Canal.

The IPCC, in its latest omnibus climate report, only assigns medium confidence to the idea that climate change has actually caused increased fire weather in some regions around the world. This, mind you, after desperately seeking to tie real-world events to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations for some 40 years now. In addition, many reports have shown that while fire activity is on the rise in some regions, were still not seeing an overall increase when considering the total areas burned at the global level.

As the Royal Society, an independent scientific academy in the United Kingdom, summarizes in a 2020 blog post updating its 2016 research on global wildfire extent, Fire activity is on the rise in some regions, but when considering the total area burned at the ground level, we are not seeing an increase an overall increase. The 2016 report was more explicit, finding: Instead, global area burned appears to have overall declined over past decades, and there is increasing evidence that there is less fire in the global landscape today than centuries ago. While the Royal Society acknowledges that climate change may be increasing risk, it also observes there are many other human activities that may contribute to more or less fires, and more or less areas consumed.

Is it clear that Canadas fire issues are climate-driven? Unless one believes that inverse correlations suggest causality, the answer is no. Thats according to a 2020 study in the journal Progress in Disaster Science where authors Tymstra et al. show a fairly sharp declining trend in the number of fires (annually) over time, and a mixed record of areas burned, though the authors note an apparent increase in areas burned over the last two decades.

In fact, as average atmospheric temperatures have risen from 1970 to 2017, Canadian forest fires have declined sharply in number and show little obvious trend in areas burnt.",Canada_sub,350,350,0,0.82,0,0,1,232

I just hope to find other people who also share my thoughts and that I'm not the crazy one.

I just saw a news article that said 11+ million students are expected to graduate in China where 1 in 5 are jobless. That's almost two times my country's entire population. And after that, a news feature about how rice crops in India and Indonesia are failing due to climate change and capitalism--the latter because the high yield rice introduced in the Green Revolution encouraged unsustainable intensive farming practices that have exhausted the groundwater and soils--and how demand for rice is only increasing even as the supply is being threatened. The quest for infinite growth, meets actual finite, fatigued Earth.

Just in the past few weeks alone we've seen more alarm bells being rung by scientists about how fast glaciers are melting, how fast the seas are heating, and the many destructions already brought about by wildfires, drought, famine, and chaotic weather patterns. And yet most people twiddle their thumbs--we talk about changing things in a decade or more, like getting rid of ICE vehicles by ... 2050? And meanwhile, more people are still being born and will have to compete in a capitalist system with arbitrary and increasingly real scarcity, in a system where you have to ""earn"" your worth to live with dignity and basic comfort. Capitalism is a grift, and by reproducing, people are participating in that grift. Capitalism only sees human beings as cogs in the ouroboro machine of infinite consumption and ever exploited labour. If someone loves their child, why would they want that child to go through this shit?

I went through one of the most competitive education system in the world and emerged broken and burned out. Today, parents in my country spend tons of resources--time, and money--to give their kids any competitive edge they can over everyone else. Kids are enrolled in extracurricular lessons and the most prestigious daycares from even before they can talk or walk properly. Parents spend years volunteering or donating to top schools and get backbreaking mortgages to live near prestigious primary schools for a sliver of higher probability that they can get their kids in these schools (as compared to just common neighbourhood schools). So many of my peers didn't grow up with a life like me. I can't imagine what the next generation's kids would grow up to be like. [This article on Slate about the writer's challenges with her suicidal daughter (despite both the writer and the dad being mental health professionals) was very difficult and sad to read.](https://slate.com/technology/2023/06/child-teen-mental-health-crisis-therapy-help.html) I grew up depressed, anxious, and suicidal, and at least I can still hope that I'll die before shit hits the fan. I don't know how the next generation will grow up, wondering about the point of life in a dying overcrowded world.

The most ironic thing is that I think us childfree people are the ones actually doing any good to the future kids. By choosing not to reproduce, we're taking off potential mouth to feed, potential competitor to resources and good jobs, to the next generation. Also, for some reason, the people I know in my life who are choosing to reproduce absolutely do not give a shit about actually doing anything to challenge the system or save the planet. I'm vegetarian and trying to be as vegan as possible, have no car, and very mindful about my carbon footprint as much as possible. The people I know who are reproducing have said something like ""why do I care about climate change if I'll die before the worst hits""--and then they go have babies? How can they say they love their children if this is the mentality they have?

(Also, don't get me started on the stupid argument that ""what if your child is the one to solve the climate crisis???"" or whatever. Talk about the heights of irresponsibility--haven't we seen the harm of just passing the piss bucket down the generations? If you love your child, why subject them with solving the fucking problem our elders came up with and we propagated?)

[This article I read recently in the Guardian was a really good surprising one--written by someone who wanted to have children, but is childless and is now growing to be comfortable with it.](https://12ft.io/proxy?&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Flifeandstyle%2F2023%2Fjun%2F20%2Fchildfree-women-men-parenting-motherhood) There's a line in the article that sticks with me: ""*not having her own children means she has time to commit to supporting other peoples*."" I think that when good people become parents in this late-stage-capitalist society, they have to become selfish--they have to prioritise their children over others' needs, because that's what expected of good parents. But people with no children of their own can support more children more seflessly than parents--I think we've seen a lot of examples on this very subreddit with childfree teachers, etc. It's so ironic to call childfree people selfish and incapable of love, when we are the ones who are probably less selfish and more loving to these kids who had no choice to be here because their parents are too selfish and immature to think about what kind of unfulfilled emotional needs they have that they try to paper over by bringing in a whole ass new life. (Also, what the fuck is this selfish idea about 'leaving a legacy' and somehow tying it to having kids? Go to therapy and be comfortable with the idea that life is fleeting, and the universe is big and we are so tiny and insignificant in comparison to everything else, and maybe use that life to just be kind and help as many people as possible).

So many parents think that they can protect their kids from what's coming because of some kind of ""love"". My parents loved me and couldn't protect me from my mental suffering, much less from all the terrible horrifying things we'll continue to see as climate change picks up pace at the rate (or lack of rate) we're going. The most radical act of resistance is to stop giving the system more warm bodies to exploit and die needlessly in the coming decades. That is an act of love to our species, and to the next generation that's already here.

The reason I am asking is because I have had sex and have a gf, but my younger brother who is 23 has never had sex. I don't mock him at all, I am even offering him to approach random women at bars to be a kind of wingman which would be risky as fuck for me in the current political climate but it makes me feel so sad he is a virgin. The reason he gives for it is he is waiting for ""the one"", and I respect that, but he has basically no female friends. I told him I'd pay out of my own pocket any visits to prostitutes he wishes for, I am even of the idea he should move to a different nation and find love. I don't want him to end up committing suicide because that's exactly the reason it was even brought up he was a virgin, everyone from my mother to our cousins noticed he was really depressed lately, and we spoke about it. He has also been brainwashed into being a mysandrist, even claiming having sex with prostitutes means he would ""not be a real man, but a mysoginist"".

Can you guess what they said?,"[https://www.fragrantica.com/news/Unnecessary-and-Annoying-Information-in-Perfume-Advertisement-17740.html](https://www.fragrantica.com/news/Unnecessary-and-Annoying-Information-in-Perfume-Advertisement-17740.html)

Here's an article that Elena from Fragrantica wrote earlier this year.

The ""unnecessary and annoying information"" in the title?

According to Elena it's sustainability, ethical harvesting, cruelty-free and vegan ingredients, and ""ubiquitous refillable bottles.""

Reducing environmental harm is so distasteful.

Right now there are record-shattering heat waves in Texas, China, the Korean peninsula, and [Mexico](https://twitter.com/extremetemps/status/1670593634427625472?s=20). People are dying from extreme heat. But, as Elena points out, fragrance descriptions are also a major crisis. They ""bore and traumatize people"" and ""the unfounded hysteria provoked by an unchallenged moral monopoly scares children.""

She also includes a video for Fragrantica users' edification, featuring widely-discredited climate change denier Steven Koonin to tell us all that climate change is actually not a thing.

Two other things to note:

1. Elena sends a not-so-subtle message by introducing this article with a video clip of ""Kramer Won't Wear an AIDS Ribbon."" Because if there's another thing that we blew way out of proportion it's the human suffering resulting from AIDS.
2. In the comments, Elena says, and I quote, ""Jordan Peterson is a great man.""",fragrance,321,321,0,0.8,3,1,0,273

If you don't, you're not worthy.

Become a doctor for women. Go into healthcare. Become an engineer and save this and cure world hunger. Become a climate scientist. Become a CEO. etc. Go into social or humanitarian work.

You feel an obligation to  'use your interests or skills to save others'.

You're told (by your parents perhaps) that your help is needed in the world.

Emotional intelligence? Become a psych.

Compassion? Doctor/nurse/healthcare.

Logical? Become an engineer and save the water crisis.

Idk. Why does it feel like our ""good traits"" are gone to waste when we don't want pursue these things? Why does it feel a little selfish?

I'm privileged that I get to choose what I want to do, I recognise that of course.

Another thing is that you have to go BIG or go home. Become a doctor, but not a nurse. Become a lawyer, not a social worker. Become an engineer, not a teacher. There's difficulty in all professions. The idea that some are more arduous than others and prove what you're capable of is so flawed - solely because qualification time or the difficulty to enter those schools.

For example...why is being a nurse so looked down upon? We need nurses. What, because someone decided to go into nursing the assumption is that they ""didn't get a chance at life"" or ""couldn't get into med""?????

Disclaimer: I'm not saying that these professions aren't necessary.  And I do think there's merit to the concept of going into a field because you're skilled at a thing or have a certain quality. I'm just commenting on how our worth is associated to things things. Then we break because we don't know ourselves. Or are faced with shame for choosing a certain path, even if it saves people - just because it's not as seemingly grand as other career titles.

LMAO I posted and missed my point: now you have this core belief that you must do something that will help others. It's even necessarily connected to worth sometimes it's a guilt thing.

Even if they do believe in climate change, they really don't understand what that means for our future. 

We live in a time of excess and abundance. That will stop. Our global supply chains cannot continue on as they are. When the first countries began to experience extreme continuous weather events combined with our fracturing economic systems. There will be civil unrest. Meaning even if your factory or processing facility is not harmed by climate change weather events, your supply networks will become more and more treacherous. How can you get your supplies to ports with more and more raiders, protestors, and civil unrest?  Sure, in the beginning the US military is going to protect the most important of resources. But for how long can that be maintained while the country around them crumbles? So now companies will find it harder and harder to implement alternative sources for their needed supplies. There will be delays on top of delays as we compete with the world for the necessary products to maintain our systems. Costs for everything will continue to rise. Most of the worlds unnecessary products that create jobs will diminish, with all the admin that goes with them. It's going to be tougher and tougher to find work. Feeding into the civil unrest.  Prices for necessary goods like electricity/water/internet/food etc will continue to climb. (If you are young, get a job within one of these fields) And this is just the beginning within the next 30-40 years (maybe sooner?) Once this happens, Northern countries will begin to open up our own open spaces to mining and processing of raw resources (especially for tech and green energy) Speeding up the degradation of more natural environments. All to support the God of more. 

LUCKILY we have sooo much overabundance currently, hopefully for a time we can figure out how to reuse/repair/recycle what we currently have. Thats the only saving grace, that we are such extreme consumers, we have excess resources now. If we learn how to repair/repurpose/recycle what we currently have instead of TAKING more and more from the earth, we will be better off. Also, in many ways life will get slower and we will become more interconnected as we rely more on local networks for support. Hopefully a push towards GIVING to the planet instead of taking. For one example trying to improve natural water catchment through plants/swales/logs to catch downpours and keep water in nature when it comes. (Look into regenerative agriculture/ permaculture and agroeconology). Another is to fight the zoning restrictions in your communities. The time for separating our businesses from our neighborhoods to create car dependency is over. Walking/Biking needs to become our main source of transportation (and WILL at some point in our future whether we do it or not). I am not one for INSANE MEGA DENSITY URBAN HELLSCAPES. But Densifying our INSANE SINGLE FAMILY SURBAN HELLSCAPES is import too. Just not while crushing any remaining biodiversity.  Redesigning our current environments to allow for these conditions will be better for all (especially health wise and air quality wise). THERE IS SO MUCH TO UNDO.  Which as a doomer I know is absolutely not going to happen. Business as Usual will continue on until it breaks. And this is not even discussing the FAR future 100-200 years and beyond. What a world that will be.

This rhetoric is designed to kill all movement and political inspiration towards mass transit and a concerted transformation of how we move around our local space and the world at large. 

They fight only to preserve auto manufacturers and car oriented infrastructure by shaming those who want an end to cars; they find it totally acceptable to abandon the radical demands for an evolution in movement for the ""cars will always exist, let's just make the best of it"" cop out garbage.

Beyond climate degredation, cars fucking suck for myriad other reasons, the most profound of which is that they fucking kill tens of thousands of people a year in the US alone. Electric vehicles will still make our lives worse, prevent our cities and suburbs and villages from changing and connecting, send us to the hospital and the grave even, and for what? A pitiful reduction in carbon emissions that won't put us anywhere near the reductions we need to save the world as we know it? The preservation and proliferation of the private capital of auto manufacturers, which will continue to erode our lives and living spaces for its own gain? All Because some quasi auto industry shills had the gal to convince people around the world, who wanted REAL change, that cars (or personal vehicles, if you're reading this and really want to get pedantic about it) were just ""always going to exist""? They fucking won't, and in time people will look back to this era of history and see cars as they are now with horror and perplexity, the same way we now regard the use of leeches to treat disease. No one could not possibly be groveling harder for corporate and private capitalist supremacy, the inherent political enemy of public transit and public well being. 

Radical voices might not be a majority, but it takes radical voices to inspire into the social imagination a new way of thinking about the world, to open the minds of the majority to the idea that our lives can exist completely without personal vehicles, that anywhere humans build settlement CAN be connected to reliable public transit, and that in such a world, our lives can be so much better. Electric vehicles won't, in even beyond-possible scenarios of success, save us from climate catastrophe. A fully mobilized transition to mass transit could actually give us a shot at avoiding catastrophe. To make this possible, it must first be imagined, it must be believed, and this is a perfect space to contribute to that imagination, but it's terribly impeded from happening when so many car brains brigade any given thread with their fresh-from-the-shit-spigot platitudes commanding that everyone get in line with the neo-liberal agenda.

So I officially went to dmv last week to change my i.d to M. I feel its the best for my safety. 

I remember when i changed the F  to M about 17 years or so ago and it was a moment of euphoria at the time. Because I felt out of place every time i had to show my i.d and they see the F and would look at me and then back at my i.d 2-3x. Then i would get she/her to d3ath suddenly even if a moment ago they were saying he/him. 

 Ive really learned myself over the years and the M became more of a stranger to me. I think i felt even more euphoric when i changed the M to X. 

But lately, especially this year it has left me feeling exposed and unsafe. I even found myself hesitant to show my i.d when asked. I started to feel paranoid every time they would stare at my i.d longer than a quick glance. I would wonder if suddenly i would be attacked by a transphobe or outed on the spot to a crowd that would put safety at risk.

I took a year off from commenting on reddit and I'd like to share some final ideas before I leave permanently.,"Hi /r/collapse,

I doubt anybody will remember me, per se, but I was active here under several usernames over the years, for the past 14 years. I came over in the grand Digg migration of 2009. Since it looks possible that reddit may soon experience a similar exodus, I'm breaking my self imposed vow of reddit silence to share some stuff with you guys. See, a year ago I took one too many bullshit bans from the admins, and I decided reddit was no longer worth my time beyond keeping apprised of the general vibe, and so I turned it ""read-only"" and I spent less time on the site.

Several years ago, during a crisis mental health state I experienced a mild epiphany about how my intolerable emotions work. From that point I realized I hadn't yet given fixing myself a very honest go, and since mental healthcare in Canada is pitiful, at best, it was on me to do it, alone. Prior to this I suffered debilitating depression for thirty years, from the age of eleven. Some of the initial sources of my depression related to collapse (described in different words back then) and the totality of the suffering extant in our world. I learned too much in an unrestricted fashion in too short a time at an age when I couldn't handle it. This was in addition to all of the other issues that aren't relevant, like family problems, which were severe.

I was also riddled with social anxiety, generalized anxiety, stress induced physical complaints, and other problems. I was a mess for a long, long time. I missed out on a big chunk of life because of it.

In recent years I've made significant progress with myself and also with understanding the larger human equation. I think I've satisfied myself in what I set out to do from the point of that mild epiphany. I've cured my depression, I've all but cured my social anxiety and I find myself much more easily interacting with people, and perhaps most important to my peace of mind, I now understand and accept why there is so much crazy in the world, why our climate crisis happened, and what we could do about the fundamental problem if we wanted to, in sufficient numbers.

I wrote about my process as I developed it, and it has turned into a rudimentary ideology of sorts. I've been working on an online version of it, and since I'm a hobbyist photographer, I've decorated it with some of my photos, in part to show what I was seeing while I was thinking about this stuff. I used the honest enjoyment I derive from photography to offset the pain and discomfort of doing the work.

This process is work. The cure for depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses we self select through poor adaptions to unacceptable aspects of our lives is to examine and analyze the things we find unacceptable until we can accept them. When we accept the facts of an issue causing us symptoms of self abusive emotionalism, those emotions start to feel inappropriate, naturally. This is the key to ""feeling better"". It's not about the pursuit of happiness; it's about freeing ourselves of the torment we inflict on ourselves in defiance of what is real.

The nutshell version of my hypothesis is as follows:

We're all addicted to the molecules of our emotions; all eight billion of us. We use the varying degrees of auto-intoxication provided by our emotions to engage in self dishonesty and self deception. We use the drug-like qualities of the substances we utilize to perceive emotions to avoid accepting what is real whenever aspects of life become intolerable to our expectations. This is what we call denial. 

Our climate crisis is happening because for generations billions of people have willfully acted in self dishonest ways that ignored the limits of our environment on every conceivable scale, most frequently because their paycheques depended on it. We used our emotionalism to tell ourselves it's alright, even good, and also to punish ourselves in vain for real and imagined transgressions. We still do, in how we tend to blame ourselves as consumers, at the behest of the corporations, of course.

Our failed pandemic responses around the world are a great mirror of our failed climate crisis responses. In both cases many of us use abject denial of the issue to poorly cope with it.

Bigotry of every stripe is fueled by dishonest emotionalism and ideas about aspects of people we refuse to accept. The propaganda reinforces the emotional addictions while the emotional addictions allow a person to self validate the false ideas. Bigotry is rooted in denial.

Really, every human problem be it greed, be it our propensity to abuse, it all comes down to our abuse of our emotionalism because this is the mechanism we use to enable ourselves to act out, and even to commit atrocity.

For each false idea we accept, or each real idea we reject with our emotionalism we form more emotional addictions. Our emotional expectations come into play here, and these are a result of our upbringings from parents and educators, from employers and friend groups, and really every social aspect of our society is governed this way, first, before law. We govern ourselves and each other with emotional expectations and emotional manipulation. This reinforces our ""right"" to remain addicted to our emotions of choice and to pursue more intense emotional experiences. And we cease to care what is real.

I tackled these problems in myself by analyzing and reflecting in isolation. I spent time accepting the chemical nature of my emotions, and my emotionalism. I spent time spectating my emotionalism and that of others. I even experimented on myself and others here in efforts to better understand aspects of myself. I learned to self dialogue and to use that to improve my self honesty, because with only myself to police myself, why not try to answer the difficult questions my fingers keep posing through the keys? I'm without a doubt in my mind a better person for exploring this stuff and I want to share it while I can in case it could help others. I don't have any delusions about changing the world or solving the human problem, but I've identified it, described it in detail enough to form methods to address it, and I've begun the work of addressing it within myself. My personal progress lends me both conviction and self worth. I'm happy to argue or debate any aspect of the ideas I pose and I don't think any of you could upset me now. What I've done here is come up with my personal truth. If you read it, you'll have to decide if it works for you. Maybe you can take it and run with it; improving it. Maybe you can figure out a way to use it to change the world. The ideas are not what is insufficient. It's my lack of ability, or perhaps creativity, to put them to use on scales greater than one.

So, for those who want a deeper dive, here you go. Thanks for reading. I'll remain long enough to discuss this if there's any interest. https://www.hiddenworlds.ca/writing/

How it's just so arrogant to claim you know God isn't real when ""really nobody can know until they die"".  It really irks me because athiesm isn't a belief there's no God it is simply not having a belief in God. There is nothing inherently arrogant about that. It certainly less arrogant than doing anything nasty in the name of God. What really gets me is  If you ""can't know until you die"" then why do mean spirited stuff because it's what God wants? The two people having this conversation actively hate anything to do with LGBTQ, climate change or anything ""woke"" all in the name of God. I can't imagine anything more arrogant than ignoring or encouraging real pain because you feel you know that's what God wants. Even though God has never acknowledged you in any way shape or form. Both of these people have also done awful things, they belong on a list for doing, that they've declared ""God has forgiven"". Another arrogant as Hell  thing I gotta say. How do you know God isn't still pissed at you?  Did he say so? Maybe he thinks you're full of shit when you claim to be regretful (I certainly think they are).

**Memory transcript: Tarlim, Venbig. Date: \[Standardized human time\] September 28th, 2136**

Jacob sat on my couch, speaking on his phone to his parents. Lightyears separated them, but the communications had gotten to the point that they were finally able to talk with instant transmission.

And you think they will approve? He asked on the phone. I couldnt hear, even with a Venlils superior hearing, but I could tell by his expression that whatever was being said was good! So theres a chance? Thats awesome! Then ah wish yall luck!

His cheeks rise once more in his toothless grin as he listens. I set the rest of the stringfruit I had been eating onto the table, feeling that their conversation was wrapping up. I really hoped to talk to him as well. Love yall too! Ah guess ahll let alla yall go. Hmm? He hummed joyfully, Thank yall so much. Ahm always a call away! Any time yall want! Love ya!& bye!

I let my tail wag as he hung up his phone and placed it on the table. So what is the verdict?

Their prospects are looking good, he replied, lot of people have been signing up to sponsor a refugee. Their ranch could accommodate some workers for the goats and orchard. And they could even give them proper pay!

Impressive. Are your parents that wealthy?

He wiggled his hand to signal the kinda sign. They got lucky with some investments. Theyre country folk at heart, so they put a good amount into peach groves and expandin the property for the goats.

That last word caught my attention. It was translated as a form of cattle. Cattle that they currently had. *Steady, Tarlim. You dont know what it truly means yet.* I wasnt about to let an unspoken fear fester in my mind. I had to know. Goats? What are& goats?

Jacob froze a bit. He had been swinging his braces ankle up to rest on my table, so it was obvious how it hung in the air. Crap. Okay! Look, this is a long explanation, and it goes into our ability to eat meat. He set his leg on the table, turning his head so that he looked at me with both eyes. We aint supposed to talk much bout that stuff, but if ya really want to know, ah will tell ya.

I did want to know. Jacob had done so much for me. He talked to me in the program. Greeted me with open arms. Built me up when the world felt like it was going to tear me down.

I didnt want him to think I would fear him for the actions of his people. Never.

Please, I say, Explain all that you can. I will listen.

He patted his hand against his knee and grinned at me. Kay! Kay& where should ah start&

A moment of silence passed as he thought. *I do hope he isnt overthinking.*

Thankfully, my fears appeared unfounded as he spoke again. Ah aint an expert in this, but ah know a bit. The goat is a four-legged animal that ah believe originally lived in hilly or mountainous areas on earth. Think& well, remember that Putyl plush? How its body looked?

Yeah, I replied, go on?

Okay, imagine that body but with a head shaped similar to a Venlil but with a nose on it. That would be the average goat.

I blinked in surprise at the mental image. So we Venlil look like one of your cattle?

Slightly, he admitted, but ah cant really call it an exact likeness. Kinda like how the Krakotl look kinda like those blue birds yall have round here.

I nodded. A human gesture I had come to include in with my ear gestures.

Well, on average, their shoulders come up to our waist, though there are some breeds that who could stand as tall as us. He chuckled to himself, and I also whistled in amusement at the thought. Those would be some big animals. Anyway, you know how humans keep animals around us, right?

I flicked my ears in the affirmative. Your dogs, cats, and that stuff.

Yeah, well, while dogs were the first animals we humans kept around as our companions, goats and a similar species called sheep were the very first animals we specifically bred to feel safe around us. He held up his hand in a calming gesture, note that this took a long time. Goats and sheep have been domesticated- a word that means bred for human use- for something over 10,000 years. Our bond with those animals is practically on an instinctual level.

It was astonishing. Ten. Thousand. Years. How does one even begin to conceive such a history? Even the founding of the Federation seemed ancient to many.

Way-ell, that may be an exaggeration, he corrected himself, Maybe not quite instinct. Ah, for one, whenever ah see a baby goat, ah just think protect. Feed baby. Keep safe. Raise healthy and strong! They are great animals. Can be stubborn and absolute crybabies, but still great animals.

He leaned back on the couch and glanced up at me. Any questions so far?

Nothing& too major, I admit. Mainly the usual about what they were& used for.

Yeah, ya know one of em already.

I keep my expression neutral. Meat. We sat in silence for a bit as I watched him nod. Its& with all youve done for me, its sometimes hard to remember that youre predators.

He nodded. Ah wont get into anything bout morality n all that. Survival and time dont really care about that. But ah can sum up the basic stance humans have had about how we treat our animals. He sat straight and moved his hand up and down to emphasize his words. A farmer should keep their animals Happy, Healthy, and Respected. Whenever one of those things were forgotten, people would get upset and move to try and make things better. Ah wont lie and say it always worked, but ah can say somebody was always tryin to make sure the animals were treated well.

I absorbed the information he told me. But why? I know that you arent like the Arxur, so& I sigh, why do you treat your& cattle& so well?

Again, ah wont go into the morality and all that, he explained, ah aint qualified to talk bout that. But there is a practical reason as well. He cleared his throat, a happy, healthy, and respected animal can do and give more than an animal that isnt. Being good to them results in more good coming back to us. Simple as that.

Part of me wanted to find a flaw in that logic. The part that still grasped to what I had been taught all my life. But& but those teachings said I myself was dangerous. That caused the facilities to be built.

*By the tenants, the humans treat the animals they eat better than we treat other people.*

As for goats in moder times, Jacob continued, ignorant of the thoughts going through my mind, eh, *modern* times, we have other uses fer em that isnt meat. Mah parents got a few kindsa goats, an somma them are fer grass care.

My train of thought stalls in confusion at his words. Im sorry, grass care?

Yeah! He laughed, see, goats will eat grass and shrubs, and their poop acts like a natural fertilizer. The goats can be rented out to people for their lawns, though they usually get rented by farmers so they can graze in their fields before planting their next crops so theres less weeds and the areas fertilized.

I needed a moment to process that. *One of the things they do to help&is eat food and defecate? Thats it?* So&one of their jobs is literally just eating and pooping? And people are willing to pay for that? Why not just buy fertilizer? Wouldnt that be easier?

Sometimes, but not as good fer the environment. He shrugged, besides, fertilizers dont get rid of the weeds as well. So when given the choice between paying for a plane or people to come out and spray the fertilizer and weed killers or pay us for our goats to do the same thing naturally, a good number will rent the goats.

It was strange logic that only worked in the context of cattle, but I couldnt find any flaws in his reasoning. And if a goat eats the wrong thing? Are they&yknow& I couldnt find it in myself to continue the morbid question. What other use would defective cattle have other than being slaughtered?

Then its the farmers fault fer letting them in the crop field.

I blink. Wrong field?

Yeah. The farming fields are in sections, and are frankly massive, so its usually easy to keep them in the correct area for grazing. He was so calm when he said that. Maybe he didnt understand my question.

Well, what if one isnt easy? What if it& attacks someone or& or just refuses to obey?

He shrugged. Then its just a goat being a goat. Like ah said, they can be stubborn. Will even headbutt ya. Just gotta work around them.

*Work around&* They attack you and you& do nothing?

He shrugged again. Yeah, pretty much. Its usually nothing major. Theyre usually pretty friendly most of the time.

I couldnt wrap my head around this. *They kept cattle&but treated them well and allowed themselves to be abused by them? Wheres the sadism? The cruelty? The&the&*

My line of thought trailed off as I realized in horror what I was doing. In some small way, I was equating Jacob to the Arxur. My friend to those monsters. I&*was I really still that far gone?* I noticed Jacob stepping in front of me, waving his arm rhythmically. Hello, Venlil Prime to Tarlim! You okay? You, uh, started lookin two ways there for a bit.

S-sorry, I stuttered. I just, I&

Look, ah can stop if its getting too much. Ah know that-

No! I shouted, it- its not that! I- I just realized that I& I was still thinking of you as like those& like the Grays. I take a deep breath to calm myself. Jacob is silent as he recognizes that I have more to say. I dont& I dont want to think of you like them. L-like the Federation says you are.

He reaches over and gives my back a comforting scratch. Youve been taught that stuff all yer life. Ah aint gonna blame ya for taking time to adjust to new stuff. We fell silent as I controlled my breathing. *Focus. Breathe. Calm&* His grin had become a comforting sight since I had first met him. He shifted back in his seat. We can still talk about something else, if ya want.

Thank you, but& I let out my breath, preparing myself. I still want to know more. About& Yall, and your goats. You said that& yall used them in other ways, right?

He seemed comforted by my imitation of his words. He picked up his phone and clicked it once. This next one will likely need a bit of a visual explanation. Thankfully, ah was able to get this past as a personal memory.

I cocked my head in curiosity. What is it?

He pointed the screen towards me. Mah first time milking a goat with the milking machine!

*The what.*

***10 Minutes Later***

I didnt even realize it was possible for my soul to be dirty. Can I clean it, or will it be that dirty forever? By the Tenants, what would Sharnet think?

& could those suckers work on her- *NO! BAD BRAIN!*

And do the Goats feel& do they feel pain?

Jacob shrugged. Yeah, its why they walk right up to the milking machines. Having swollen udders can be painful fer them.

No, no. *Shuck Shuck Shu-- STOP IT!!* aHEM. Does the machine hurt them?

He shook his head. Not at all. The suction is gentle enough that it is just like one of their own kids suckling.

*White liquid flowing through tubes into a container. The machine being set on- CEASE!* And you& Use this milk?

As food, is the shortest answer. Animal milk is extremely nutrient dense so it was essential to our survival in northern climates in early history. Nowadays, goats milk is mostly processed for Cheese and Yogurt, both of which are eaten for health and for pleasure.

*They can do that?* You are& you are able to eat another animals milk? Not just your own?

Yeah! Well, Not all of us! This is actually really interesting: Jacob sat on the edge of his seat and met my eye, an excited gleam behind it, So humans who raised goats lived in these mostly hilly areas that got cold. Not many things we could eat would grow there, but plenty that the goats could eat. Now, this is slightly related to our ability to eat meat, so you ready?

*Anything to get my mind off Sharnet in-* Yes, Im ready.

He clapped his hands together. Okay! So, because not as much would grow, there would be times when people didnt have much food, so theyd go hungry.

*And so they ate the goat.*

Now youre probably thinking we ate it, but no! My ears flicked up in surprise as he continued. See, a goat as a meal would only last so long, but a goat that was lactating would feed the family for much longer, as well as give nutrients that the humans werent getting otherwise! So, with time, it became an evolutionary advantage for humans to be able to drink milk into adulthood!

I gave my head a quizzical tilt, but didnt you say not all humans could?

Right! Because the animals that gave us milk werent everywhere! Humans in places with more sun and fields didnt need as much milk, so they never developed the ability; milk tolerance was probably our most recent evolutionary trait! So, yeah! Keeping goats around literally caused us to evolve.

So much history. Animals that literally changed how they evolved. And& and these are the animals some Gojid refugees would work with?

Yep! He leaned back in his seat, confident in his words. Milking, cleaning, moving, all that stuff.

I wag my tail. I hope that they come to realize how great an honor they would be being given.

Jacob let out a content sigh. Fer those that stay, ah hope so too.

It's time for a break.  I feel that it's become an unhealthy addiction, to pull r/ufos up multiple times per day, scrolling for something titillating, something that could be the beginning of answers.    


Recently, I've let the ideas on here affect me too deeply. I'm kind of afraid to be alone in my own house, because I don't really feel alone, what with the possibility of aliens among us or trans-dimentional beings watching everything we do. Whenever I look up at the sky, I'm expecting and terrified of seeing something abnormal, despite never having witnessed it before. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Before this ufo addiction, I got overly into following and working on projects related to climate change. I was trying to come to terms with the reality-changing idea that humans are creating an uninhabitable world. All the reports about us needing to stop emissions or we'd shoot past 1C degree of heating and so on, really wasn't good for me either, but I kept consuming articles and worrying about it.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've decided that I'm not the type of person who should be entertaining these thoughts about reality and where humans stand and what the purpose of life is. I'm a father now, and I need to focus on being a strong provider for my family as well as a good role model of a balanced person to my child. That should be my purpose now. I don't want to become a negative, screen-addicted hermit, but I'm becoming that way. Maybe other people can view and share in communities like this and manage it all ok, but not me.

Edit: Adulting is hard. apparently this has always happened but i didn't pay attention in high school or college, and now I've learned a new thing adults do: actually talk about/pay attention to the weather!

Edit 2: I've lived in Dallas my entire life (besides college at A&amp;M) and this weather issue is still out of the ordinary. I didn't think this post would cause such a stir, you adults and your weather talk! But, here we are with multiple takes. Most people defending weather services even though the forecasts are completely off? what happened to the days of checking the weather and not having to do math to see if it'll rain on us?

If you'd like to read previous parts, they're linked below, along with brief summaries in case you prefer to just jump right into the new part:**

**[Part One: Alien learns what ""sleep"" is and how humans prefer to do it in a comfy bed with blankets and pillows. And they find it utterly adorable.](https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/13tti7v/alien_learns_what_sleep_is_and_how_humans_prefer/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)**

**Vr'ocria and Human Aldrick are sent on a survey mission together. Things go south, Aldrick makes sure they're safe, and then Vr'ocria learns what human sleep is and how vulnerable humans are when they sleep. Vr'ocria's people don't sleep, but enter stasis, a form of rest in which they typically stand, and they are still slightly aware of their surroundings. Vr'ocria finds human sleep utterly adorable, and also decides she will protect Aldrick while he sleeps. And she also develops a massive crush on him. (Her scales turning purple is her version of blushing)**

**[Part Two: An alien + human adventure with such shenanigans as poison drinking, befriending dangerous wildlife, and fighting a space pirate.

**Vr'ocria and Human Aldrick end up assigned to be partners. Vr'ocria is a witness to both human shenanigans as well as human durability, but she also begins to learn about the limits of the human body--they are not invincible.**

**She and Aldrick begin to fall in love, and they finally confess their feelings for one another when Vr'ocria admits to accidentally forming a mate bond with him. Vr'ocria's nestmate, Galek, is not very happy about her being involved with a human, but begrudgingly respects her decision.**

**Galek, Vr'ocria's nestmate, meets Aldrick. It goes about as well as you'd expect. But in the end, they come to an amicable understanding. Also, her scanner goes missing...**

**On to the story!**

""Maybe *this* will be the one where nothing goes wrong,"" Aldrick mused. He and Vr'ocria walked side by side down the corridor as they headed to the survey lab.

Vr'ocria gave a wry smile. ""I don't know. We seem to have a track record.""

""Hush, don't jinx it.""

""'Jinx' it?""

""Bring bad luck on us by talking about it."" Aldrick held up his hands and wiggled his fingers.

Vr'ocria laughed. ""I don't think that's how that works, but whatever you say.""

Upon reaching their destination, they entered the double doors to the lab. It was a circular room, with a display screen taking up most of the far wall, and an oval table standing in the middle. Seated at the table were the other four members of the survey department. The rest of the space was occupied by computers and lab equipment.

The two of them joined their colleagues, climbing up into the work stools. The table doubled as a map maker, and the interactive screen was currently turned on and displayed a topographic map ofVr'ocria leaned forward to read the label floating near the edge of the screenBeta-4.

""Oh, here's your scanner!""

Vr'ocria looked up to see Lekot leaning across the table, scanner in hand. Vr'ocria took it gratefully. ""You said you found it in the break room?"" She asked.

""Yeah, it was on the table."" Lekot settled back into her chair, adjusting her feathers.

Vr'ocria frowned. She couldn't remember bringing her scanner into the break room, but then again, the past couple of weeks had been a blur. ""Well, thanks for grabbing it for me. Requesting a new one would've been a pain."" She slid it into her pocket.

Aldrick glanced at the time displayed on the screen. ""Isn't the meeting supposed to start now? Who's leading?""

""Prax,"" Nevut grumbled from beside Lekot. ""He's late.""

""Yeah, he does that a lot."" Anat was leaning back in her chair with her arms crossed.

Olna huffed. ""He's such a"" she garbled out a foreign word that Vr'ocria didn't understand, but the nasty tone was not lost on her.

""Glad I'm not the only one,"" Aldrick muttered.

Nevut raised an eyebrow. ""Didn't you yell at him once?"" He asked. The others turned to Aldrick curiously.

Aldrick blushed under everyone's scrutiny. ""Yeah, once,"" he admitted. ""He was responsible for assigning us to a tundra planet, and Vr'ocria's Ethyrian; her biology isn't built for that. It wasn't safe for her.""

""So you called to yell at him?"" Olna laughed. ""You're lucky you didn't get fired.""

Aldrick shrugged. ""Good thing I didn't."" He reached out and grabbed Vr'ocria's hand, and she squeezed back, her spine buzzing.

Just then, the lab doors whooshed open, and Vr'ocria swiveled her chair around to look. Lieutenant Prax strolled in, clearly in no hurry despite being late. He took his place at the head of the table, back straight, blue hands folded in front of him. His purple eyes swept over them, and Vr'ocria resisted the urge to squirm. She felt like a bacteria specimen under a microscope.

""Your next assignment is Beta-4,"" Prax began without preamble. ""Each team will be assigned a plot of land on the southwestern continent in the southern hemisphere. After that, you know what to do. Scan and record like always. Any questions?""

The six of them exchanged glances, and barely a second passed before Prax slammed his hands on the table. ""Very well then. You'll find your assignments in your files.""

When they didn't move, Prax waved an impatient hand. ""Dismissed.""

*This could've been an email,* Vr'ocria thought bitterly as she stepped down from her stool.

""Not you two."" 

Vr'ocria and Aldrick both froze, turning to meet Prax's gaze. He scowled down at them. ""I need a word.""

They sat back down. The others trailed off, casting glances over their shoulders as they exited the lab. 

Prax pursed his lips. ""The two of you have gotten yourselves into quite a bit of trouble recently.""

Aldrick scowled. ""We didn't get *ourselves* into trouble""

Prax held up a hand. ""Mr. Elivan, I did not ask for your input.""

Aldrick closed his mouth, seething.

""Now,"" Prax lowered his hand, ""I do not make it a habit to read reports of my agents being carried to the med bay. I understand we have been seeing an increase in pirate activityparticularly the Norvidiansand I would urge the both of you to take extreme caution every time you leave the ship.""

Vr'ocria and Aldrick were quiet for a moment.

It was Vr'ocria who finally spoke. ""Lieutenant, is there something you're not telling us?""

Prax raised an eyebrow. ""What makes you think that?""

Vr'ocria gestured to the empty lab. ""Why are you only telling us this?""

""Because you two are the only ones who've been attacked by pirates twice in one cycle, Ms. Thidryl."" He leaned forward. ""Almost like you're being targeted.""

Vr'ocria's throat tightened.

""And why would we be targeted?"" Aldrick broke in.

""You tell me.""

Silence.

Vr'ocria and Aldrick already had their suspicions on why. Some time ago, a Norvidian had accosted them while they were on a survey mission on Theta-7. Vr'ocria ended up killing him. A few weeks later, they were attacked by a whole crew, who were intent on killing Vr'ocria in revenge. She and Aldrick just barely managed to escape with their lives. Ever since then, they'd suspected someone sold her out, because how could the Norvidians possibly have known she was the one to kill him and where to find her?

Vr'ocria stared at Prax, her blood rushing fast as she  fought to keep her scales from changing color and betraying her feelings. Next to her, she could see Aldrick clenching his jaw hard enough to crack a tooth.

Finally, Prax leaned back with a sigh. ""Look. I do not wish to see either of you hurt.""

Vr'ocria blinked at the sudden change in demeanor.

""So,"" he continued, ""I'm telling you both now: be careful. Dismissed.""

After a moment's pause, Vr'ocria and Aldrick rose to their feet and headed for the door, leaving Prax sitting at the table behind them. Vr'ocria could feel his burning gaze on the back of her head as the door closed behind them.

""That was weird,"" she muttered.

""I don't trust him,"" Aldrick growled. ""Not one bit.""



The trip to Beta-4 was blessedly uneventful. The continent they landed on had a tropical climate, warm and humid and rich with plant life. They trekked carefully through the jungle, scanning and recording as they went. The area was uninhabited by intelligent life, but wildlife had beaten down small trails through the brush, and Vr'ocria and Aldrick decided to stay close to them.

""Good thing we brought bug spray,"" Aldrick remarked as they passed a swarm of buzzing insects hovering in the branches of a tree. ""And at least there's no gnats here.""

""Gnats?"" Vr'ocria asked as she bent to scan a pink fern covered in small yellow blooms.

""They're tiny little shits that buzz around in clouds."" Disdain dripped from every word. ""They crawl all over you, get in your eyes, your nose, your mouth, and some even bite. They're itchy, tickly, horrendous little fuckers and I want them extinct."" He stepped carefully over a thorny vine. ""I grew up in a cold climate, but I've been down south where it's warmer and wetter, which is where the gnats live. They're *awful.""*

Vr'ocria shivered, despite the heat. Another reason she was reluctant to visit Earth.

As if he could read her mind, he turned to give her a reassuring smile. ""Don't worry,"" he chuckled, ""if we ever get the chance for you to visit, we have plenty of ways to keep you safe from gnats.""

She raised an eyebrow. ""And polar bears?""

He barked out a laugh. ""I'd never take you anywhere near where polar bears live. Too cold for you."" 

They came to a fallen tree trunk lying in their path, so thick that it rose above their heads. Without hesitation, Aldrick grabbed onto the rough bark and began climbing. Vr'ocria hesitated for just a moment before she pocketed her scanner and followed suit.

Aldrick reached the top first. He crouched and held out his hand to help pull her up. They took a moment to catch their breath and survey their surroundings from the new vantage pointnot that they could see very far through the thick jungle.

Aldrick took a deep breath through his nose, inhaling the scent of dirt, sap, and flowers. ""Y'know, Earth has a reputation for being a 'deathworld,' but it really isn't that bad.""

Vr'ocria gave him a doubtful look. ""Deadly animals, poisonous plants, extreme climates, frequent storms""

Aldrick laughed. ""And no other planets have these things?""

Vr'ocria faltered. ""Well, *most* don't&""

""'Most' doesn't mean 'all,'"" he said, bumping her shoulder. ""I think so many people get caught up in the&*legend,* for lack of a better word, that they forget that humans are also just *people.* Sure, maybe in comparison we have some extraordinary abilities and come from an extraordinary planet. But we're not monsters, we're not invincible. We're just a species who learned to adapt to our environment."" He gave her a sad smile. ""I just don't want you to be afraid of visiting my home one day.""

Vr'ocria sighed, her scales tinged red. ""I'm sorry."" She took his hand. ""I should know better by now. I mean, I was afraid of *you,* at first, until I got to know you.""

""You mean, until you saw me sleeping?"" Aldrick said with a sly grin.

She blushed purple. ""I'd never seen a human vulnerable before!"" She defended. ""And it turns out you're really cute when you sleep&""

He threw back his head and laughed. ""I'll have to write a dating manual for my human buddies."" He held his hands out as if holding up a sign. *""'How to seduce aliens: go to sleep.""*

""Shut up."" She punched his arm, but she was grinning.

They continued working as the sun began to set. During the last couple hours of daylight, they came to a cliff side that stretched high into the purple sky above their heads. Vr'ocria drifted in one direction and Aldrick went in the other as they cased the cliff's tightly packed soil. Vr'ocria noted that it must be several million years old, based on the layer pattern.

She set her scanner down on a rock and produced a small sample phial from her pocket. Gently, she began scraping off bits of red soil from a particularly thick layer. 

Just as she was placing the cap back on, a scream carried across the cliff side. Her head snapped up and she took off, the phial of soil slipping from her fingers in her panic. ""Aldrick?"" She called as she ran, her scales yellow and standing.

She skidded to a halt at a drop off that was a few meters deep. At the bottom, Aldrick stood staring with wide eyes at something next to the cliff, clutching his arms.

""Aldrick!"" Vr'ocria scrambled down the boulders, knocking dirt and rocks loose as she went. She stumbled to the bottom and ran to him. ""What happened?"" She demanded, grabbing his shoulders and raking her eyes over him. ""Are you hurt?""

He huffed out a breath and smiled weakly, his cheeks red. ""No, no I'm fine, sorry,"" he jumbled out. ""I'm not hurt, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you."" He covered his face and let out a strained laugh.

Vr'ocria frowned, her blood still rushing in her ears. ""What happened? Why did you scream like that?""

Finally, he raised a hand and pointed towards the cliff. ""Centipedes.""

Vr'ocria turned. Crawling among the rocks at the base of the cliff were a small group of worm-like creatures with many legs, each creature a few inches long.

""I mean, they're not *Earth* centipedes, obviously,"" Aldrick supplied weakly. ""But they sure fuckin' look like them.""

Vr'ocria looked back at him, her mouth opening and closing. ""They'rethey're bugs.""

""Yes.""

""You screamed at&bugs?""

The red flush went all the way to his ears. He didn't reply, but it was answer enough.

Vr'ocria looked back and forth between him and the family of insects. ""...Why?""

""Because *look* at them!"" He threw his hands out. ""Too many legs! Too many! And *pincers?* Why! Why do they need those""

""Oh planets."" It finally clicked. ""You're afraid of bugs?""

""I'm afraid of *centipedes,""* he clarified defensively. ""They give me the heebie jeebies and they live in my nightmares, I fuckin' hate the things, they can go extinct right along with gnats""

Vr'ocria clapped a hand over her eyes and laughed, her scales easing back to their usual green. ""By the moons, a human is afraid of some insects.""

""Don't judge me,"" Aldrick whined. ""I had a traumatic experience as a child when my cousin put a centipede in my crib""

Vr'ocria wrapped her arms around him, still laughing. ""Don't worry *prisai,""* her mother tongue slipped out.
""I'll protect you from the scary centipedes.""

Aldrick grumbled in her ear, and she couldn't contain another fit of giggles.

*BOOM.*

An explosion rattled the ground, sending both of them sprawling in the dirt. Vr'ocria covered her head with her hands as dust and bits of rock rained down, flinching as pebbles pelted her arms.

It was over within seconds, but somehow felt much longer. Vr'ocria cautiously sat up, looking first to Aldrick. He was pushing himself up as well, appearing unharmed.

""What the *fuck* was that?"" He demanded, ruffling his hair and sending dirt showering loose.

Vr'ocria squinted up at the drop off she'd climbed down from. ""It came from up there."" Something glinted at her feet, and she reached forward to grab it. It was a warped piece of metal. She turned to show Aldrick, who looked just as baffled as she was.

Together, they rose to their feet and slowly climbed back up the boulders. At the top, the center of the explosion was obvious. A small crater was blown into the side of the cliff, and one of the boulders bore freshly jagged edges.

Vr'ocria's spine rattled, sending a shiver through her scales. ""That's where I left my scanner."" She looked down at the small piece of metal still in her hand.

""Holy shit."" Aldrick was pale.

They stood staring at the few scattered remains of what used to be Vr'ocria's scanner.

""That's *super* not normal,"" Aldrick finally broke the silence.

She scowled. ""Someone has it out for me, no doubt about it now.""

He squeezed her hand. She could feel his fingers shaking.

Canadas PM [Justin Trudeau said](https://news.yahoo.com/canada-wildfires-shroud-york-apocalyptic-030940723.html) that **this was Canadas worst wildfire season ever**and its only June. Alberta experienced [its hottest May ever](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/you-guessed-it-may-was-the-hottest-on-record-for-much-of-alberta-including-edmonton-1.6863755), data show.

Its [too late to prevent an ice-free Arctic](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/06/too-late-now-to-save-arctic-summer-ice-climate-scientists-find), scientists say. Some experts from a [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38511-8) in *Nature Communications* are saying that [**the Blue Ocean Event**](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/06/world/arctic-sea-ice-free-climate-change) **could happen in the 2030s**. I believe it will arrive faster than expected. 

Oil and water are the two most precious resources in modern society. In Iraq, [water is running out](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/03/iraqs-oil-boom-blamed-for-worsening-water-crisis-in-drought-hit-south) because of **water-intensive oil extraction** processes. Socialize the damage, outsource the profits; a tale as old as time. 

Europe felt [its hottest summer ever](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/05/expected-european-drought-likely-to-worsen-the-regions-water-crisis-.html) last year, and its water is quickly vanishing. Potato harvests in Ireland [are dropping](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-65778102). The UK is [training for **Mediterranean-style wildfires**](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-65848872) in the near future. A [study suggests](https://www.thenewlede.org/2023/06/human-caused-warming-to-surpass-paris-agreement-goal-by-2037-analysis-finds/) that **humanity will hit 1.5 <b0>C warming by the year 2037 at the latest.**

80+ towns and villages [have been affected](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65819591) by flooding following the **destruction of the Khakhovka dam in Ukraine**. Both sides in the War blame each other. The dams reservoir was important for regulating the cooling system of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europes largest, which is still under Russian control. 41,000+ people had to be evacuated from regions under control of either side. Ukraine has labeled the attack as **ecocide** and claims Russia will destroy more dams.

Russia reportedly [shelled evacuees](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20230608-%F0%9F%94%B4-live-flooding-extends-over-600-square-kilometres-after-kakhovka-dam-breach-says-ukraine) from the floods.

COVID: &gt;!I had the opportunity to take a couple flights last week, and I traveled through a busy international airport. Thousands of people walking around and I only saw one other person wearing a face maskand I confess that there were times in the airport and on the plane when I unmasked for a while, something that would be unthinkable a couple years ago. Yet the reality of (Long) COVID hasnt changed whatsoever. [The virus endures](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/08/long-covid-impact-quality-of-life-cancer-study), even if our discipline does not.

However, every week my masking resolve weakens a bit more: sometimes I go to the supermarket unmasked, I forget to take a mask on public transport, and I am slowly influenced by the madding crowdand as the world heats up, masking becomes much more irritating. Thinking back to those early years of COVID, it feels like a strange dream, a moment of collective&&panic/insanity/clarity?!&lt;

The city is modernizing rapidly and there are lots of nice malls, modern hospitals/clinics (much more affordable than in the US to get an MRI/CT/blood work), and even an IKEA. Even the pollution is slowly improving.

But&the one thing which I cannot get over is the heat. Usually, Im able to tolerate the heat in India, but this year the monsoons are delayed so the summer heat has been prolonged. This makes the heat very annoying and detrimental to health. Its worsened by the fact that modern architecture doesnt work with the local climate, it works against it (at least in hot climates where things like glass windows are horrible at maintaining building coolness).

So why is climate change not being addressed as a public health emergency? Why are we not working alongside civil/environmental engineers and architects to build passive cooling systems and researching ways to maintain the coolness of the human body? Why not develop more efficient air conditioning systems that dont heat up the outside environment as much?

My engineering professor once told me that civil engineers have saved the most lives as a profession (in terms of raw numbers) because of advances in clean air/land/water infrastructure and sewage systems. So why arent we working alongside civil engineers to design systemic solutions to climate change? Or if not systemic solutions, then why not at least work on solutions to cool down the human body?

Back in high school and college, I was torn between civil/environmental engineering and medicine. I eventually chose CS in college for a stable source of income, and then later pursued medicine. Slowly I fell into the AI/ML hype. But that itch for the intersection of civil engineering and healthcare (public health) never went away.

This is exactly why I posted this and why I love the community. Thank you to everyone.

For those of you simply commenting the very helpful ""climate change isn't real"" or ""it's arsonists being hired to drive the climate agenda"" and the like you can believe what you want, but the reality is that **smoke is affecting locations it hasn't before**. Why is this smoke making headlines but the fires out west are not? Because this smoke is unusual, and most of the populations here have not experienced it. We need to prepare for this to continue happening. Yes, wildfires have always happened. And yes, we need to prepare for them anyways.

* **You will be affected by a wildfire someday.** Even if you've never seen wildfire smoke in your area in 50 years. Climate change is real, and expected patterns are changing rapidly alongside it.
* **Get an air purifier before you need one.** And get a good one. I got a small NOMA one to hold me over when I woke up to smoke rated as ""hazardous"" after sleeping with my window open while waiting for a larger one to be delivered - **everyone was out trying to get a purifier at the same time - that is NOT the position we want to be in. Avoiding that is why we prep**. I was being cheap and stubborn refusing to get one until I suddenly needed one. Now I have 2 subpar ones. Don't be me.
* **Smoke appears quickly.** I went to bed after sitting on my balcony the evening before and enjoying my tea, breathing the fresh air. I woke up at 9am - having went to bed at 10pm the night before - thinking my apartment was on fire. I now intend to **get an air quality monitor** for inside that will alert me if a change like that happens again for any reason. I'd be in a much better position if my window hadn't been open for 11 hours.
* On that note, **monitor air quality. Set air quality alerts.** I monitor weather, but not air quality. Had I been monitoring air quality - which I really should do given my asthma - I could've prepared for this well in advance.
* **Monitor the fire situation near you and up-wind from you**. This can give you an idea of what may be coming before the air quality warnings appear.
* **Cooking releases particles into the air, even if nothing is burnt.** Rightfully, the focus in prepping is how to cook food - but cooking food in this case is worsening our air quality. Having no-cook food on-hand is essential.
* **You and your partner/people will have different ideas of what is a necessity and a good reason to go out/stay in** \- my partner thought going out in person for an air purifier was insanity and we should hunker down, I thought since we had the window open for 11 hours the air quality indoors wasn't much better than outside and an air purifier was essential at all costs. I went out to get one, he was upset about it and worried sick. I thought him going to work was unnecessary and ridiculous, he thought he needed to to pay for the air purifier. If we already had one it could've been avoided.
* **You need to have a plan for if the power goes out while the smoke is present.** Is there a point where you will bug out? When? What level of the AQI (Air Quality Index) will you decide to leave? Where will you go? How will you get there safely? If you cannot leave how will you protect yourself and your family from smoke inhalation?
* **Keep on top of chores, especially if you are in an apartment.** Do laundry when the basket is half full, take out your recycling whenever you get the chance. You want to avoid going out and breathing that in as much as possible
* **Have non-toxic, no-smell cleaners on-hand**. Everything that has any smell, anything that sprays, adds to the pollution in your home.",preppers,503,503,0,0.83,1,0,1,305

I am puzzled about possible changes under the hood how Stellaris treats species, custom empires and galaxy generations, b/c some expected behaviours seem to have changed. Annoyingly.

&lt;EDIT&gt;      


Thanks to u/-MGX-JackieChamp13 and his friends relentless testing I found the [solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellaris/comments/142c9ax/comment/jn5nm22/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to the problem, and want to add one further piece to the puzzle:

1. **Portrait/Species name:** For species to be grouped as sub species, it's not sufficient to share the exact same portraits and names tripple (Singular, Plural, Adjective), but it sure is the first condition, that has to be met.
2. **Hidden flag:** If first condition is met, empires also need to have the flag ""ignore\_portrait\_duplication=no"" set to no in the user\_empire\_designs\_v3.4.txt in your Stellaris root folder. This is the file were your custom empires are. This flag cannot be set in the UI, but it seems to be somehow set by manually editing the species name stuff. This seems to be condition #2 and usually nobody would run into problems, because you have to build your custom empires in the first place, right? & right?
3. **Avoid UNE/CoM templates:** Not quite: In my case, even manually editing and setting the flag was not sufficient for the UNE to be a sub species, while every other custom human empire was, because I used a edited (and its unique template with scripts) version of UNE. For whatever arcane reason, also if condition #1 and #2 are met, the UNE derived, edited and saved custom empire will NOT be a sub species.

**Solution: If you want several custom empires to share a species, becoming sub species, always build them from scratch and make sure condition #1 is met and you'll be fine.**

&lt;/EDIT&gt;

I love to roleplay with several human empires, which all share the same species, same portraits and naming scheme, most of the time even same species traits. Before 3.8 this resulted in:

1. **All humans, same species**: all humans from the different empires being subspecies of my human founder species, with the (intended) implication that they were treated as my founder species as well (no slaving, all could be easily gene-modded etc.)
2. **Diplomacy, even if xenophobe**: a diplomatic bonus between the different human empires b/c of shared founder species, which made it more likely they would ally against common threats approaching mid game (also intended)
3. **Policies/Gene-Modding:** even with varying traits and/or preferred climate (continental, arid, alpine etc), the game treated the humans as one and the same species, making them sub species

&amp;#x200B;

This seems to have changed since 3.8. I am not entirely sure, because I rebuild the several force spawning human empires. Double checked the naming (Human, Humans, human). The thing is though, only the first human species I make contact with, will be another species entirely, all the while every subsequent human species will be grouped as subspecies of them (the first contacted other humans). This is & rather weird. And it does not matter which one. No mods, pure vanilla.

These people grew up in the most tumultuous times of Indian history. A lot of the way they behave is because of the situations they grew up in.

1. They were born in newly independent India. They saw a lot of wars. Like the war with China. The Bangladesh Independence war. An emergency. All of that political unstability, not only makes it hard to earn a living but it also makes them cling on to every paisa they earn and not spend it.
2. They grew up in License Raj. They grew up in a period when India was a pseudo communistic country. Where the word profit was a Taboo. For them to prosper in the society, they either have to kiss the ass of someone in the power or be the person in power. I.e. get a government job. Bank job or UPSC or whatever. This is the reason why this generation places so much emphasis on ""Log kya kahenge""/""what the society think"".
3. Their parents saw the freedom struggle taught them to hate the west. They themself saw the way the country was harassed by the Nixon government. So they grew up with a distaste for everything west. And subsequently distaste for foreign culture. Look I am not saying that the westerns are saints. But there is definitely a lot to learn from western countries/Westerners. These boomers don't understand that shit. There is toxic shit in Indian culture that was never purged because we never had a lot of interactions with people outside of our country on account of actively despising them.

Compared to the boomers, Millenials and Gen-zers are a lot more open minded. They grew up in a time when India was opening up it's markets. They grew up in a time when private sector was becoming stronger and stronger. We grew up watching foreign TV shows like Friends, Doraemon etc. We are much more accepting of foreign culture. A lot of us travel abroad for masters or atleast know plenty of people who live abroad. Majority of us want jobs in private sector. We believe in meritocracy not ass kissing. 

I think when all of these Baby boomers die or retire country is going to progress a lot.

On the flip side though, we are still in the early stages of capitalism. It's the best period to be alive. Gen-alphaers and their kids who will grew up in late stage of capitalism will be royally fucked. That is assuming climate change doesn't fuck them up already.",india,486,486,0,0.71,0,0,1,259

Ive posted here before about my parents move to FL because of their beliefs. To reiterate, they believe the Pope will soon make a decree that everyone worship/rest on Sunday. As Seventh-day Adventists, they believe that they should rest and worship on Saturday, and that all other Christian denominations follow the devil by worshiping Sunday. To them, the Pope is going to enact this law very soon, and will persecute SDAs (the true Christians) before Jesus comes. 

Unfortunately they talk about this every single day. I cant catch a break. I already made it clear to them that I wont be moving to FL with them because 1, I dont want to live in FL, and two, I dont want to support their stupid beliefs. However, I feel like this is going to be a forever thing. Theyll never stop thinking like this even when they see decades flying by and nothing occurring. Recent climate change is only exacerbating their beliefs. My parents literally dont care about anything else Im life but the end of the world. Theyre trying to drag me down with it and its just making me depressed. Theyre so convinced that they have me almost convinced that Adventism is the truth. They can pull up Revelations and explain their way through it easily and I guess thats why so many people fall under that trap. Anyway, I feel terrible and I hate that I was born into this strict, toxic, and controlling religion. How do I navigate this? Why do I believe Adventism might be the truth even if I dont believe.

Hoping she has a great experience. 

Husbands: if youre having any difficulty in booking getaways or vacations heres a mini checklist that might help. 

1. Check her availability 

2. Check and double check your short term and long term finances to make sure its feasible 

3. Research 

4. Gather information. You want to know:  

- exactly when youre leaving and arriving at your destination. 

- transportation. Especially if youre doing something like a cruise where you may be flying into a port. How will you get from the airport to the port? 

- currency exchange (if international) and to be aware of additional charges to cards. Make note to inform your bank ahead of time of your travel plans if you have concerns about your accounts being locked 

- Packing. Medications, proper wear for climate and shoes. Does she have the proper face or hair care products? Is there a super market nearby she can get things she needs? If youre going to be swimming do you have enough extra clothes? Is there a washer and dryer in your air bnb, resort, or etc? 

5. Make sure the details are taken care of. The idea of a vacation for your wife is the ability to just have a good time and not have to worry. If you take on the planning that means she doesnt have too, and it will be much calmer.

Last fall, the storm Merbok slammed into Nome, AK and the arctic. Winds knocked down power lines and caused millions of dollars worth of damage, released hazmat, all sorts of shit.

The back porch of one bar in Nome was taken out by waves which would normally be 40-50 feet away. I have video of a massive propane tank being tossed around in the street. A restaurant on the same street hooked up pumps to bring water out of the basement, and the pumps shorted the buildings electrical and the building burned to the ground with 45mph winds going. I watched the fire trucks try to spray it down, but 90% of the water was blown away by the wind. I have video of that too.

Why do I think this belongs in r/collapse? Because hurricanes arent supposed to happen in Alaska.

We get crazy winds on a regular basis just because of our location. The chugach winds and hurricane-force winds are not unheard of, no, but a storm cell like Merbok slamming our state is not a normal thing.

Just two weeks ago, a high-ranking agency representative came to us and almost casually mentioned that we should expect more storms like this. My jaw dropped.

The heating of the northern Pacific is terrifying. Indigenous Alaskan communities are already having to relocate (see Kivalina and Shishmaref) even before this due to rising seas and erosion.

Im from the southern US and Ive rode through idk how many hurricanes. Its expected there with warmer climates. What terrifies me is the fact that these same storms are now expected to hit places like Alaska on a semi-regular basis. Alaska has rarely ever had events like this happen and the infrastructure is not built to deal with it.

Its another example of climate change hitting our indigenous communities far harder than most others. I think that people, worldwide, need to freak the fuck out about hurricanes hitting Alaska. Its so far removed from normal.

Alaska is one of the places people mention as a refuge from climate change, but imagine leaving a political and meteorological hellscape like Florida and finding yourself being hit by fucking hurricanes in the arctic.

Please bring up Merbok in any conversation about climate change. It got about a week worth of coverage in the news, but the implications and expectations will go far into the future.",collapse,462,462,0,0.97,0,0,0,88

I'm thinking this couple is pretty selfish. And the 'ethicist' poorly-informed, to say the least.

How can anybody know the future enough to know how to 'prepare' for it for one's future offspring? And does this couple really have the RIGHT to bring kids into the world they are at least PARTIALLY aware is going to be a hell ride?

At least they are honest enough to admit it's mainly because they have just an 'oh-so-SPECIAL' love of children that they feel more entitled than Joe and Mary MAGA, who will be non-engineers and therefore presumably less financially capable of successfully raising children.

For those behind a paywall, here's the article:

*Today, The New York Times Magazines Ethicist columnist answers a readers question about personal responsibility and climate change.*

*Is It Wrong to Bring a Child Into Our Warming World?*

*I have always loved babies and children. I babysat throughout high school and college, and do so even now as a full-time engineer. My fianc<e9> was drawn to me because of how much he appreciated my talent with and love for children. We have many little nieces, nephews and cousins whom we love but dont get to see often. We also have always been clear with each other that we would try to have biological children soon after getting married.*

*That being said, my fianc<e9> and I, who are both Generation Z, care deeply about the planet and painfully watch as scientists predict that the earth will reach 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming by the 2030s. Is it selfish to have children knowing full well that they will have to deal with a lower quality of life thanks to the climate crisis and its many cascading effects, like increased natural disasters, food shortages, greater societal inequity and unrest?*

*We realize that a childs very existence adds to our carbon footprint, but as parents we would do our best to foster an environmentally friendly household and try to teach our children how to navigate life sustainably. My fianc<e9> says that because we are privileged as two working engineers in the United States, we can provide enough financial support to keep our children from feeling the brunt of the damage from climate change. Is it OK to use this privilege?  April*

*From the Ethicist:*

*Here are two questions that we often ask about an action. First, what difference would it make? Second, what would happen if everyone did it? Both raise important considerations, but they can point in opposite directions. The first question asks us to assess the specific consequences of an act. The second question asks us (as Kant would say) to universalize the maxim  to determine whether the rule guiding your action is one that everyone should follow. (I wont get into the philosophers debates about how these maxims are to be specified.) Suppose someone pockets a ChapStick from Walgreens and asks: What difference does it make? One answer is that if everyone were to shoplift at their pleasure, the retail system would break down.*

*Theres no such clash in answering those questions when it comes to your having at least one child. The marginal effect of adding a few humans to a planet of about eight billion people is negligible. (A recent paper, by a group of environmental and economic researchers, projects that by the end of the century, the world population could be smaller than it is today  though thats just one model.) And if everybody stopped having babies, the effect would be not to help humanity but to end it.*

*Im not one of those people who will encourage you to imagine youll give birth to a child who devises a solution to the climate crisis. (What are the odds?) Still, its realistic to think that children who are raised with a sense of responsibility could  in personal and collective ways  be part of the solution, ensuring human survival on a livable planet by promoting adaptation, resilience and mitigation.*

*Probably the key question to ask is whether you can give your offspring a good prospect of a decent life. The climate crisis figures here not because your children will contribute to it but because they may suffer from it. It sounds as if youve already made the judgment that your kids would be all right, supplied with the necessary resources. That is, as you recognize, a privilege in our world. But the right response is not to reduce the number of children who have that privilege but to work  together  toward a situation in which every other child on the planet does, too.*

My college friend group has slowly split into two groups over the past 15 years: the super rich corporate capitalists making over $400,000/year or the low wage artists and service professionals, who will probably never see six figures. Whether it be a friend who works for a law firm and represents mega-corps... Or an investment banker friend, with literal millions in the bank, who Venmo requests even our brokest friends for a $8 latte, the capitalists have become insufferable. Another is working for one of the biggest water polluters in the world, yet apparently cares about climate change. They all embody socially democrat, fiscally conservative politics which just says youre a hypocrite. 

Ive watched the desire to hoard wealth turn these once generous and considerate people into greedy, vapid shells of themselves. Theyve all compromised their values in egregious ways and justified it in the pursuit of making a living. I reached a breaking point this week when one of them had the audacity to make fun of a lower ranking poor coworker who made only $250,000 a year, when they know my ass barely hits $60k. Knowing how much they value your worth by the size of your bank account, I cant even imagine what they say about me behind my back. 

Anyway, I just needed to rant about how much it sucks to lose friends because theyre obsessed with money. And if anyone else is going through something similar, youre not alone.

EDIT whoa thank you for those who gave awards to my late night rant. A little more info:
- we are all in our mid 30s
- the person who charged us for coffees bought us them without us asking, so it was like they charged for a gift no one asked for. They also come from family money (extra annoying). And they sent the Venmo request two days after bringing us the coffees, making it even more petty 
- I know that high wage workers are still workers and necessary for solidarity against the capital class. Unfortunately some of them have become landlords (they all own their primary residences and some have investment properties they rent >"") and have shown the clear drive to become part of the ruling capital class. Theyre all on track to become c-suite/partners

https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/13x7qm6/i_am_leaving_her_tonight/,thr00waway175,2023-06-01,1685592525,I am leaving her tonight.,"Ive been with my partner for 3 years now. As always things started off great she has a daughter that Ive grown to love as my own even though her bio dad is still in the picture. I dropped everything for them, I got a bigger apartment, I switched jobs to make more money I changed everything to give them the peace of mind they deserve, it was all better than I could have ever imagined until this weekend, thats when I found out shes been cheating me with her sisters roommate. She didnt have a great relationship with her sister when we first met and I encouraged her to rekindle it because I knew it bothered her. Her sister is a free spirit, rarely holds down a job, drinks and does absurd amounts of coke and x just to pass the time. She lives with 4 guys who her and my partner have known since middle school, they seemed cool enough the few times Ive hung out with them so whenever she wanted to go hangout with her sister I wouldnt bat an eye. I found out during our camping trip for Memorial Day weekend, when she was in the bathroom with her daughter I grabbed her phone to look at some of the videos she had been taking but admittedly curiosity got the better of me and I went through her messages and thats when I saw her texts to the roommate. I felt almost paralyzed, it almost felt like I was going to blackout but I somehow managed to gather myself and chill out I took some screenshots of the texts to have as proof and put her phone back in her bag. I didnt say anything to her we only had a few hours left before we came home and I wanted to spend those hours with her daughter. The past few days Ive been thinking of what to do and the best solution I can think of is just packing my stuff up and ghosting her, I am quitting my job tomorrow morning and after shes left for work Ill grab my stuff and leave her with a print out of the messages I read. Im still in a daze. My whole life is gone now, the future I saw for us is nothing and Im not sure how to process all of this still. Im calling my brother a few states away to see if I can stay with him and set up shop elsewhere. Tonight though I have to lay down next her and Im not sure I wont break down knowing whats coming.

Update: First I want to thank everyone for their kind words and advice. I am doing the best I can right now. I am meeting with my boss in a hour or so to wrap that up. I am also taking the advice of talking to her babies dad about me leaving, we have always had a good relationship and I want to give him a heads up on whats coming. As far as the apartment goes we only have 3 more moths on the lease and I am planning on paying for the remaining months mainly so her daughter has somewhere to stay for the time being. I made sure she knows that I love her and always will, holding her this morning knowing it was the last time I would ever see her was the most difficult thing Ive ever done and it took everything inside of me to not sob while doing that. Ill update later once I have all my stuff and am away from the city. Thank you guys you have no idea how comforting it is to have your kind words to come back to.

Update 2: I know I said I would update when it was all over but you guys are right I should have a talk with her daughter before I go so when her bio dad picks her up from day care I will be meeting them and talking to her in person before I go. It means a lot that he is letting me do this and hopefully its just enough closure for her.

Update 3: I met up with bio dad and the little one. You guys were right I really needed to have that conversation with her to let her know that even if Im not there that Ill always love her and that it isnt her fault that I am leaving. I did cry. I cried a lot actually. I know Ill eventually fade from her memory and just become someone she has vague memories with but Ill remember her until my last breath, I never knew I wanted kids until she came into my life and showed me what true and pure love is. I thanked her dad for letting me have that moment with her, I gave him that Disneyland picture in case she ever asks about me. He is aware of what went down and who my ex is spending her time with. As for my ex I left the screenshots on the kitchen table along with my key to the apartment. Ive blocked her number and my family did the same, I also blocked any mutual friends numbers in case she tries to reach me through them. Its crazy that Im leaving behind the last 5 years of my life but I honestly cant stay here. My brother is taking me in out in LA until I figure out what my next move is. I am off all social media and once I get to my brothers Ill change my number. Im sorry if this update is anti climatic but thats how I wanted all this to go down. Ill update you guys when I am all settled down. I do just want to say that I loved them with every ounce of my being. Ill miss the walks around the apartment complex, the random trips to Walgreens, watching Sofia the first until I memorized the episodes by heart, especially coming home from work and feeling like I mattered, feeling like I had a purpose and that no matter what went on during my day that all of that wouldnt matter once I opened that door. Ill miss all of it but I know deep down I have to let go. Be safe everyone Ill try and update this soon.

Update 4: I want to thank you guys for all the support and even the few negative comments that I got on this, its nice knowing I wasnt completely alone through the early parts of this whole situation. I am at my brothers now and still getting set up but Im hopeful that things will get better with time, Ill be honest its brutal right now and i still get flooded with sadness constantly. On the drive here I had to finally pull over and let it all out, Im sure right now we would be having dinner or watching a movie and instead Im on my brothers porch trying to not cry while I type this out. I havent heard anything from the ex yet which is helping but knowing her shell try and find a way to reach me. Everything reminds me of them, I saw a little mermaid poster earlier and almost lost it, I never got to take the little one to see it and that just kills me. I do wonder though what I was missing or where I came up short for this to happen? Ive run circles around it and I cant explain it. I hope I heal fast from this because Ive got a whole life to live. I hope I did enough for the little one to not have been hurt by all this, I hope she keeps a sliver of me in her memory and I hope she is loved like I loved her. Again thank you all for the positivity and the encouragement. Ill make it out of this, Ive done it before and Ill do it again. Maybe Ill update this sometime in the future or feel free to send me a message. Be safe and I wish everyone the absolute best.",TrueOffMyChest,5022,5022,0,0.99,3,0,2,402

While this is going to be mostly about things that myself and many others in the community who have similar play time find to be pain points the overall vibe I get from people is that we all **love** this game. **This is strictly my own opinion and by no means speaks for the entire community.** This is going to be a very long post. There will be a TLDR at the bottom. Please keep any discussion civil, as it is a videogame after all.

# General

* **The stash currently feels really bad.** Baked into the core design of the game are legendary aspects. By design you'll find yourself holding onto aspects, even for different builds than the one you are currently playing because you may want to try something new. Multiple of each of the good aspects in fact because nothing feels worse than finding a great upgrade and being unable to use it because you're missing a good roll on the aspect you need to put on it. Of course, you can always place a minimally rolled version of the aspect onto the item in the meantime but a lot of the time an item with worse stats but a perfect roll on the aspect ends up being *significantly better* than an item with better stats and the minimum roll.

Maybe you want to try a different aspect out and may end up wanting to swap back? Holding onto multiple of each aspect is something that is encouraged because of the core design around gear progression, and you quickly find yourself running tight on space once you start factoring in uniques you're going to be holding onto and well rolled rare items (even ones that are good for builds you aren't currently running, because they may be builds you want to try out later).

This isn't even factoring in playing more than one character yet. As it stands right now, it is **extremely tedious** to play more than 1 character at endgame due to the limited slots. All of your characters share the same 200 stash spots, and 150+ of those are quickly eaten up by your first character's aspects, rares, and uniques. People are already having to create alt characters just to hold items as they level up new characters (remember doing this in diablo 2?), but in diablo 4 you're limited to just the characters inventory to hold extra stuff and you are limited to 10 characters per account. You at most on a single account have the additional inventory to comfortably play 2 characters of different classes. And you will need to do loads of juggling items into the stash from alts if you do.

200 stash spaces **PER CHARACTER** feels like the bare minimum required to be comfortable while not completely eliminating the need for inventory management once a character reaches late game. Maybe have a large character stash and a smaller shared stash?

&amp;#x200B;

* **We need a search function for both the stash and the inventory.** I want to be able to search key words like ""crit"" ""vulnerable"" ""pulverize"" ""ice shard"" and have every item with these key words in them highlighted in my stash/inventory. Path of Exile uses key words and regex code to allow you to search for items, for example, you can type ""ilvl: x"" ""tier: x"" and many other syntaxes. Let me do this in diablo 4 so I don't have to search through all of my items multiple times to find an aspect that I swore I had in there.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Respeccing the paragon board is tedious.** Why can't I right click on a node and remove every node beyond it for the combined gold cost? Just add an ""are you sure"" confirmation button.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Looking for group is nonexistent**. While I feel a world chat system would be miserable moderation wise, can we at least get communities back like in diablo 3 so people can find people looking to do similar content? Clans can only hold 150 players, so as it stands right now you are forced to use outside of the game sources to find groups for things in a game with group content being a large part of the design.

# Leveling

* **The campaign length feels right to me**. On average it took players who were rushing the campaign 12-14 hours to complete. Keep in mind we were all new to the game, on first characters with no account wide unlocks like aspects, lilith shrines, and skill points. As people become more experienced with the campaign leveling your first character in a season will be much faster, you'll know dungeon layouts, where to go, what level you need to be to go rush a specific aspect, what side quests you can grab along the way that don't slow down campaign progression much that will enable you to unlock skill points without much backtracking, etc. I estimate an experienced player can blast through the campaign in 8 hours or less. Which is on par with other ARPGs.

&amp;#x200B;

* **The big elephant in the room is post campaign leveling.** Another thing that's baked into the core design of the game is paragon, and the insane amount of power creep that comes with paragon. Of course, paragon can be tuned, but that can potentially bring along a whole host of tuning and balance changes that need to occur alongside it and by no means would be a quick fix and would have the potential to massively change the way the game works. I don't think mass nerfs to paragon is the answer.

Leveling provides such a **MASSIVE** power gain that players are feeling like progressing through nightmare dungeons is a waste of time prior to reaching level 100, which in itself will take somewhere in the realm of 80-100 hours of total time played if being efficient. 80-100 hours to reach level 100 isn't an issue, the issue is the wild amount of power creep that comes with reaching level 100. To put it into perspective, with my current build, the very last 37 paragon points (or level 91-100) grants me the following assuming a level 21 glyph.

\+35 int, 64 dex, 15 str, 55 willpower, +13% dmg to poisoned enemies, +132% crit dmg with core skills, + critical strikes increase the dmg enemies take by you by 2% up to 12% for 20 seconds, +10% werewolf skill dmg, +13.5% crit dmg, + critical strikes with werewolf skills restore 2 spirit.

**Thats crazy power creep for 9 levels**

In other ARPGS, while there is power creep behind levels it's not nearly this much. In Diablo 2, the power difference between a level 90 vs a level 100 character is negligible. In Path of Exile it's the same. In Diablo 3 paragon points make a big difference very early, then have huge diminishing returns and requires a huge time investment to see a big difference through farming for main stat. This game takes level power creep to a completely different planet.

**The wild amount of power creep from levels creates another issue.** I touched on this before but doing any of the actual endgame content prior to reaching level 100 felt like a waste. Go into any community discords looking for group channel and you will see nothing but ""LFM Demise t4 be able to clear your own lane"" posts. Having a **normal dungeon** being the best source of exp in a game where exp provides this large of a power boost is a huge oversight by the devs. There is no reason for a normal dungeon to have that amount of mob density, not only is it the best exp farm in the game, it's also the best source of loot. **As it stands currently, it seems there is no real reason to push nightmare dungeons other than to level glyphs.** This can change as the community figures out where and how specific uniques drop, but at the moment this is the current climate of the game - get to level 100, then you can actually play the game is the meme right now.

**So, what is the solution?** In my opinion, they need to nerf the density in the dungeons people are farming for exp and shift that exp gain over to nightmare dungeons through adding exp modifiers to sigil modifiers. The harder the mod and the higher tier of the sigil, the more exp you gain. They also **need** to increase the density in nightmare dungeons. Ill touch on density in the next section though.

# Endgame

* **Tree of whispers.** This feels like it was designed as a small piece of entry level endgame content. Compared to the legendaries you obtain through helltides and NM dungeons (were going to ignore champions demise here) it isn't worth doing this for drops, as you can target farm specific item slots or aspects much easier through things like helltide and obol farming. I started doing whispers immediately when I reached WT4 with my group, but after that I saw no reason to ever go back to it. It's good for farming sigil dust but that's about it. And you get enough extra sigils farming NM dungeons leveling glyphs that it doesn't matter much anyway. But maybe I'm missing something here?
* **Helltide.** A common complaint I'm seeing is the density, it feels quite clunky to run from small pack of mobs to small pack of mobs. Constantly mounting up and dismounting. Aside from that, this is a piece of content that will become irrelevant over time as you play longer. Its solid early for target farming specific slots from chests + the obols you get from the events to gamble. Aside from that the only reason to do helltides is for forgotten souls and materials needed to craft elixirs and incense, which over time you will need less and less of them as upgrades become scarcer and you have a stockpile of mats to use for when you run high tier NM's.

I feel like after reaching level 100 I have another week of running helltides regularly before I stop touching them entirely as I average 30-40 forgotten souls per helltide in a group. And you get more uniques through farming champions demise while you level anyway. The only time I've gotten a unique from a helltide was from a mysteries chest, and that was 1 unique. Meanwhile my first stash tab is almost entirely full of duplicate uniques that I've gotten during the champions grind to 100.

This is of course assuming there aren't helltide specific uniques that come from say, maybe the mysteries chests but if that were the case, I'm positive we would have known about it by now.

* **Nightmare Dungeons** The density in nightmare dungeons seems no different than the density in their normal variant, which in many dungeons is pretty abysmal. Maybe it feels worse than it is because I am so used to the crazy density inside of champions demise, but the low density inside of nightmare dungeons can't be ignored.

There are many builds that rely on lucky hit procs to function and feel good, and any dungeon with poor density (which is most of them) makes these builds feel awful to play and slow, because they are awful to play and slow in there. For example, my warewolf tornado build has no survivability and no damage outside of grizzly rage, but I am entirely reliant on lucky hit procs from large packs of monsters to maintain good uptime on it. Even with 30% CDR and 34.5% additional lucky hit inside of Champions Demise I find myself outside of grizzly rage for anywhere from 1-10 seconds normally, hoping for more lucky hit procs to get it off CD faster and dodging CC to stay alive. It **genuinely feels awful** to play a build reliant on lucky hit procs inside of most nightmare dungeons currently. I've seen other level 100 players playing different builds that need lucky hit procs to sustain resource or cooldowns say the same.

This will likely be a completely different story for those pushing high tier NM dungeons where you have Zdps builds grouping large packs of monsters where you blow your cooldowns and burn the pack down.

I touched on the exp and drops in nightmare dungeons earlier, this is largely due to the lack of density in these dungeons of course. Ive ran numerous NM dungeons tier 50-65 and ive found 2 uniques from dozens of runs. I think this only feels so bad because of how insane champions demise is for drops and exp, it's like going from driving a ferarri to a nissan altima.

# TLDR

**Overall, I feel they need to rework the density in dungeons and add density and exp scaling to nightmare dungeons. Add density to helltide, and buff rewards from the tree of whispers. This would fix numerous issues in my eyes.**

Leveling feels fine length wise, campaign progression time feels fine to me. But feeling like you need to spam the same normal mode dungeon for 60+ hours the moment you finish the campaign due to how much power creep comes with levels doesn't feel okay to me.

This game is awesome, the endgame gameplay loop on the surface is SUPER fun and engaging but is overshadowed by the player feeling the need to rush level 100 by design and the fastest way to do that by miles being to spam a specific dungeon for days or weeks on end. The power creep through levels is totally fine in my opinion, but at least make the best way to level be to engage with the actual endgame content gameplay loop.

**And PLEASE give us a better stash and a search function.**",diablo4,2468,2468,0,0.92,5,1,1,1136

I live just east of New York City. For the past few days weve been warned of unhealthy air quality due to the smoke from up north - but overnight it became so much worse. This morning I noticed the sky was pink, and the air was oddly hazy. As soon as I stepped out the door, the sharp smell of woodsmoke sent my head reeling. Seconds later my throat and my lungs were on fire. Coughing, I tried to clear them, but couldnt. The damage was done. I ran back inside in a panic; and thats when I realized the smoke had seeped into the house through cracks in the window frames. I stuffed them with socks and scarves, but. There was no escaping it. The awful smell was everywhere. It made my head hurt and my stomach sick. When I looked down the street, the trees and houses were shrouded in thick yellow fog. It was terrifying. 

On my way to babysit I began to cry. Even with a mask on each breath that I took was so painful. I thought of the suffering animals, who had no where to go for relief. I worried about the elderly and the people with compromised lungs. I wondered what I could say to comfort the three year old boy I adore. How could I lie to to those innocent eyes? How could I tell him dont worry? When I know just what this means. Its the beginning of the end. The end of life as we know it. Maybe the end of life itself. 

We need to accept that we will not avert this catastrophe. That there is no way this ends well. People have known this was coming for decades and still failed to act with urgency. Now its too little, too late. This will not get any better. What we are witnessing here is only a glimpse of the coming horror. How can anyone justify dragging more innocent people into this hell? How can anyone convince themselves that their children, or their childrens children, will inherit a world worth living in? Anyone who thinks that the next hundred years will be just like the last is delusional. I want to cry again as I think about the selfish jerks who ignored all the warnings, lied to themselves, and had children knowing that this was coming. Especially in the last decade. And ESPECIALLY in the last three years. There is no excuse. They condemned these children to a life of suffering on dying planet. The selfishness and willful ignorance is so ugly it makes me sick.

I want to tell that little boy how sorry I am that he wont grow up in the world I knew, the world as it was before we crossed the point of no return. Hell never know anything different. He will grow up under the shadow of fear and come of age in dystopia. Im 25 and Ive seen the effects of climate change accelerate within my own lifetime; my dad is 60 and has never seen anything like this here either. Never. Seeing things like this - witnessing such dramatic changes in just the past decade - is terrifying. Ive lived long enough to know what it was like before we crossed this threshold. This is not normal. Ive never stepped outside and been unable to breathe because my throat and lungs were burning. 

This is proof that NO WHERE is safe from the horrors of climate change. We are all connected in this world, because we all breathe the same air. Thus we will ultimately all suffer the consequences of human pollution and global warming. And thats exactly what caused this. Anyone saying otherwise lives in a fantasy. How they are still in denial I dont understand. We know why the fires are worse this year : Canadas dry as a bone. There is less and less snow and rain each year as the climate becomes more unstable. This year has been the driest yet. Thats why the fire is ripping right through it. More trees are burning than ever before. 500 million football fields worth. Thats why theres so much smoke. Even if its true that it wouldnt be like this here if it werent for the storm blowing it south, that doesnt matter - it shouldnt be like this anywhere. This is brutal. Anyway, in the future wildfires may be coming for New York too as things continue to get worse. Unfortunately most people dont care about a crisis until it affects them, and thats why its gotten to this point. They dont understand that our world isnt as big as it seems. The places being affected arent distant states or countries. Theyre our next door neighbors. 

I cant help but feel angry that this is the world I and other young people inherited. A world that is on fire. As I write this the sun is a lurid red. The light falling through the west windows has stained our floors the color of grapefruit juice. Smoke fills the air between houses, and veils the trees of the distant forest. Death is at our back door.

Five conservative Supreme Court Justices released an opinion yesterday rewriting environmental law passed by Congress in order to further hamstring the EPAs regulatory power.

The case, Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency, originated when Michael and Chantell Sackett decided to fill an Idaho wetland site with gravel and sand in order to build a home. The EPA informed the couple that their actions violated the Clean Water Acts (CWA) prohibition on polluting waters of the United States, which is defined to include wetlands adjacent to traditional navigable waters or their tributaries. Because the Sacketts property contained wetlands adjacent to Priest Lake, it was protected under the CWA.

The Sacketts sued the EPA and lost at both the district court and appellate court level. Wetlands, the 9th Circuit [ruled](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-454/201324/20211124133353006_21-454%20Sackett%20Opp.%20-%20final.pdf), are still protected bodies of water even if separated from navigable waters by an artificial barrier like a road or a man-made dikean accurate reading of the regulation, [33 CFR <a7> 328.3](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/33/328.3).

&gt;The court of appeals emphasized that the wetlands
on petitioners property are only 30 feet from the unnamed tributary to Kalispell Creek, which feeds into
Priest Lake, and that they are separated from the tributary only by an artificial barrier[] (a road), which
does not defeat adjacency. Pet. App. A33 (citing 33
C.F.R. 328.3(c) (2008) (Wetlands separated from other
waters of the United States by man-made dikes or barriers * * * and the like are adjacent wetlands.))

&gt;The court noted that the
evidence before the EPA showed that the wetlands
provide important ecological and water quality benefits to Priest Lake and are especially important in
maintaining the high quality of Priest Lakes water,
fish, and wildlife.

Wetlands are extremely [important](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-02/documents/wetlandfunctionsvalues.pdf) to the ecosystem and to human life. Wetlands store water to prevent and mitigate floods, store carbon within plant biomass, filter pollutants before they reach other bodies of water (including the water we drink), provide critical habitat for wildlife, and generate tourism and recreation dollars for the economy. It is also an increasingly rare ecosystem, in both the U.S. and the [world](https://unfccc.int/news/wetlands-disappearing-three-times-faster-than-forests). According to a 2009 [estimate](https://archive.epa.gov/water/archive/web/html/vital_status.html) by the EPA, the U.S. has lost over half of its original wetlands since the 1600s, including over 62,000 acres destroyed from 2004-2009 alone.

None of this mattered to five Supreme Court justices who, led by Samuel Alito, limited the ability of the EPA to protect what remains of our wetland ecosystems. The final ruling of the court can be confusing: All nine justices determined that the Sacketts land is not protected under the CWA, but five went farther and rolled back EPA protections of *more* wetlands.

First, a reasonable person could disagree with the unanimous opinion that the Sacketts land is not protected wetland. Take a look at [this photograph](https://imgur.com/9u8FiIR) included in court briefs. Under the CWA, the property is clearly adjacent to both a large protected wetland (Kalispell Bay Fen) and a large navigable water (Priest Lake). A road is, under the CWA, a man made barrier that does not negate the adjacent definition. Furthermore, the property is located 30 feet from an unnamed tributary that feeds into Priest Lake, about 300 feet away. These facts would seem to prove adjacency and, thus, prohibit building on the site.

Nevertheless, the court ruled in favor of the Sacketts. But Justices Alito, Roberts, Thomas, Gorsuch, and Barrett didnt stop there; they essentially [rewrote](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-454_4g15.pdf) the CWA to exclude wetlands that are adjacent to larger bodies of water.

&gt;In sum, we hold that the CWA extends to only those wetlands that are as a practical matter indistinguishable from waters of the United States. This requires the
party asserting jurisdiction over adjacent wetlands to establish&that the wetland has a continuous surface connection with that water, making it difficult to determine where the water ends and the wetland begins. 

In other words, Alito and the four other justices ignore the plain meaning of the word adjacent because they would rather invent their own statutory language that allows property owners and corporations to destroy wetlands. As summarized by Mark Joseph Stern of [Slate](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/05/samuel-alito-wetlands-opinion-lost-brett-kavanaugh.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=traffic&amp;utm_source=article&amp;utm_content=twitter_share):

&gt;Alito wrote: We dont like the definition that Congress used. It could lead to crushing fines for landowners and interfere with mundane activities like moving dirt. It interferes with traditional state authority. And it could give the EPA truly staggering regulatory authority. Five justices on the Supreme Court think all of that is very bad. So they declared that, instead of applying the statutes words, the court would impose a different standard: Only wetlands with a continuous surface connection to larger bodies of water merit protection under the Clean Water Act.

Alitos opinion was so extreme, even Justice Kavanaugh penned an argument against it, joined by Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson.

&gt;I write separately because I respectfully disagree with
the Courts new test for assessing when wetlands are
covered by the Clean Water Act. The Court concludes that
wetlands are covered by the Act only when the wetlands
have a continuous surface connection to waters of the
United Statesthat is, when the wetlands are adjoining
covered waters. Ante, at 20, 22 (internal quotation marks
omitted). In my view, the Courts continuous surface
connection test departs from the statutory text, from 45
years of consistent agency practice, and from this Courts
precedents. The Courts test narrows the Clean Water Acts
coverage of adjacent wetlands to mean only adjoining
wetlands. But adjacent and adjoining have distinct
meanings: Adjoining wetlands are contiguous to or
bordering a covered water, whereas adjacent wetlands
include both (i) those wetlands contiguous to or bordering a
covered water, and (ii) wetlands separated from a covered
water only by a man-made dike or barrier, natural river
berm, beach dune, or the like. By narrowing the Acts
coverage of wetlands to only adjoining wetlands, the Courts
new test will leave some long-regulated adjacent wetlands
no longer covered by the Clean Water Act, with significant
repercussions for water quality and flood control
throughout the United States. Therefore, I respectfully
concur only in the Courts judgment&

&gt;The difference between adjacent and adjoining in this
context is not merely semantic or academic. The Courts
rewriting of adjacent to mean adjoining will matter a
great deal in the real world. In particular, the Courts new
and overly narrow test may leave long-regulated and long accepted-to-be-regulable wetlands suddenly beyond the
scope of the agencies regulatory authority, with negative
consequences for waters of the United States. For example,
the Mississippi River features an extensive levee system to
prevent flooding. Under the Courts continuous surface
connection test, the presence of those levees (the
equivalent of a dike) would seemingly preclude Clean
Water Act coverage of adjacent wetlands on the other side
of the levees, even though the adjacent wetlands are often
an important part of the flood-control project. See Brief for
Respondents 30. Likewise, federal protection of the
Chesapeake Bay might be less effective if fill can be dumped
into wetlands that are adjacent to (but not adjoining) the
bay and its covered tributaries. See id., at 35. Those are
just two of many examples of how the Courts overly narrow
view of the Clean Water Act will have concrete impact&

&gt;The scientific evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that
wetlands separated from covered waters by those kinds of
berms or barriers, for example, still play an important role
in protecting neighboring and downstream waters,
including by filtering pollutants, storing water, and
providing flood control. In short,
those adjacent wetlands may affect downstream water
quality and flood control in many of the same ways that
adjoining wetlands can.

Justice Kagan, joined by Justices Sotomayor and Jackson, wrote her own opinion castigating the majority for usurping Congress:

&gt;And still more fundamentally, why ever have a thumb on
the scale against the Clean Water Acts protections? The
majority first invokes federalism. See ante, at 2324. But
as JUSTICE KAVANAUGH observes, the Federal Government has long regulated the waters of the United States,
including adjacent wetlands. Post, at 11. The majority
next raises the specter of criminal penalties for indeterminate conduct. See ante, at 2425. But there is no peculiar
indeterminacy in sayingas regulators have said for nearly
a half centurythat a wetland is covered both when it
touches a covered water and when it is separated by only a
dike, berm, dune, or similar barrier. (That standard is in
fact more definite than a host of criminal laws I could
name.) Todays pop-up clear-statement rule is explicable
only as a reflexive response to Congresss enactment of an
ambitious scheme of environmental regulation. It is an effort to cabin the anti-pollution actions Congress thought appropriate. See ante, at 23 (complaining about Congresss
protection of vast and staggering additional area).
And that, too, recalls last Term, when I remarked on special
canons magically appearing as get-out-of-text-free cards 
to stop the EPA from taking the measures Congress told it
to. See West Virginia, 597 U. S., at ______ (dissenting
opinion) (slip op., at 2829). There, the majoritys non-textualism barred the EPA from addressing climate change by
curbing power plant emissions in the most effective way.
Here, that method prevents the EPA from keeping our
countrys waters clean by regulating adjacent wetlands.
The vice in both instances is the same: the Courts appointment of itself as the national decision-maker on environmental policy.

&gt;So Ill conclude, sadly, by repeating what I wrote last
year, with the replacement of only a single word. [T]he
Court substitutes its own ideas about policymaking for Congresss. The Court will not allow the Clean [Water] Act to
work as Congress instructed. The Court, rather than Congress, will decide how much regulation is too much. Id., at
___ (slip op., at 32). Because that is not how I think our
Government should workmore, because it is not how the
Constitution thinks our Government should workI respectfully concur in the judgment only.",Keep_Track,2059,2059,0,0.98,1,0,1,76

I caught it, a lump already rising in my throat. A maze of warped, crooked trees lay before us, their skeletal boughs thrust together like sweeping arms. Id never even seen a wooden person beforeI didnt yet know whether Id have the courage to face one down. My greatest fear, back then, was disappointing my old man.

Dad guided us along where spaces occurred naturally until, a dozen or so paces into the forest, the foliage thinned out.

Over his shoulder, he said, So tell me Mr. McCann, isnt Redburn a national heritage site? Im surprised you got permission to bulldoze the place.

Is that how youre gonna fix this problem? Show these tree people Ive got the right paperwork?

I was just curious. Youre not the first visitor who tried buying up land for cheap.

Our employer rolled his eyes. Well, Patrick, the simple fact is this new development is gonna be the magnet that attracts opportunity. The suits are scared of eco-warriors who cry on Facebook, sure, but they also know everything I touch turns to gold.

Didnt the wildlife trust try to stop you?

Course they did. Luckily, I dont believe in nos.

Huh, thats funny. I could have sworn the judge said no to your appeal about the recovery order. You had to hand over, what was it, 19 apartments?

Those fraud charges were about as legitimate as your little wooden friends, Tom hissed, his voice bitter.

Upset this outsider was belittling our beliefs, I clenched my jaw, tight. Dad, however, just chuckled. The sceptic couldn't rile him upnot my father, unshakeable as an oak tree, tall and rangy with a shock of greying hair and a long, straight nose, same as mine. He said, If you dont believe this crap, why come begging me for help?

Two things. One, I came *asking* for help. And two, Im no mug. Ive seen this scam before. You locals make up fairy tales and scream cultural heritage air quotes accompanied those words""to extort the evil entrepreneur from the big city. Well, fair warning, if I dont see some supernatural shit tonight, you arent getting a single cent from me. Sound reasonable?

Sure does. Fair warning though, Id strongly advise not letting any wooden person touch you.

Oh gee, Ill try. Mr. McCann looked down his nose at me. Ronan, was it? What age are you Ronan?

Im twelve, I said.

Twelve, huh? And is that old enough to come ghost hunting?

Ronan can take care of himself, Dad answered. My face flushed with pleasure at the compliment. Besides, theress things he needs to learn.

The trail twisted three times, carrying us through marshy grass, alongside a narrow stream, deeper and deeper into the gloom. From out amongst the endless darkness, I could hear the crunch of dead leaves, the snap of rotten wood.

Above the canopy, where we could see it, the moon drifted in and out from behind thick, billowing clouds. And my electrified nerves jumped at every cry of a tiny animal, barely audible beneath the trees whispering in the breeze.

Well? Mr. McCann said, after a minute of silence.

Well what? Dad asked.

Isnt this the part where you tell me about the tree pixies?

I thought you didnt believe in this stuff?

I dont. But Im not having the crew rock up tomorrow and say you didnt do the right magic tap dance to cleanse the evil spirits.

What do you know about them already?

I know theyre keeping me from stream rolling this shithole.

Dad ducked beneath a bough. Is that all?

They kill children who wander through the forest late at night, blah blah blah. Its your boilerplate urban

Before the baron could finish a mouse scurried out from beneath a downed log. He yelped, hopping from one foot to the other, a little foxtrot, and got to work trying to stomp the little critter, who moved way too fast.

Without looking back, Dad said, Dont worry, Ive seen braver men than you jump out of their skin out here.

Despite the pent-up anxiety, I chuckled. My father was enjoying this. A lot.

Mr. McCann muttered something too low to hear.

Well, the kid things partly true, Dad said on the far side of a nestle of ferns. What they *actually* do is his voice trailed off there. You know what, its too spooky. We dont want Tom running off without any evidence, do we Ronan?

Stop milking it and tell the bloody story.

Dads beam of light swept across the ground in low arcs. Ronan, you wanna take this one?

Around us, trees closed in from every angle. As we bullied our way along, our cheeks and arms were gouged by the lacings of sharp branches. It felt like the forest kept reaching out, placing hands on us. Almost against my will, I found myself admiring their resemblance to hideously elongated figures.

Side-by-side with the developer, I cleared my throat. The wooden people are like us. Or, well&some are. Others not so much. Do you know what a doppelganger is?

Nooo, he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm.

A doppelganger is

Hes joking Ronan, Dad said, as he pushed through more scratching bracken. Beyond it, there lay an ocean of leaves, choked in darkness.

I said, Oh. So, theres this colony of wooden people who live out here in wooden towns. In the old days, they stayed away from us, and we stayed away from them. People didnt worry about them. Like hurricanes. If you lived somewhere that gets a lot of hurricanes, youd probably think about them, but in Ireland weve never had a hurricane because its not a warm tropical climate, so we dont worry about them. It was the same with wooden people. It was hard to stumble across them.

But then we started building cities and railways and stuff. That meant their homes kept getting destroyed. So, they started moving around. But then we started building *more* stuff so

Through a narrow gap, I glimpsed movement and hesitated. A chilly draught sent dead leaves scattering across my boots.

Mr. McCann said, Let me guess, soon they had so little space they got angry and attacked?

Well, no. First they tried to explain their problem.

Oh, so our wooden friends speak English? Theyre like those talking trees in Game of Thrones are they? He went and stood beside a nearby birch, pressed his mouth up against a large hollow in its bulbous trunk, and said, Hey Treebeard, you awake? Mind if I bulldoze this place? The entrepreneur faced us, grinning, those porcelain teeth prominent against the gloom. Well waddaya know, he said its completely fine.

In the middle of a patch of dirt and mud and weeds, Dad said, Quiet, Both of you.

Branches scraped together roughly as the forest shivered in its various joints.

What is it, a fox? Mr. McCann asked.

Dad silenced him with a gesture. From somewhere unseen, whispers rang out. Or maybe it was just the wind. My trembling hand struggled to keep hold of the flashlight. Again and again, I wiped the palm sweat on my jacket and prayed Dad wouldnt notice.

Dad faced us. Ronan, you stay here with Mr. McCann. Im gonna""

Oh no, the cynic fired back. If I stay put, youll go out there, smoke a cigarette, and come out panting like youve just performed an exorcism.

Unable to mask his agitation, Dad exhaled through his nostrils. You came asking for my help, now Im giving it to you. Nobodys trying to rip you off, I promise. You dont live as part of nature, so you dont see it, but Ireland is bleeding magic. The world is. And now its starting to fight back. If theres wooden people out here tonight, youre gonna leave this forest a changed man, believe me. But right now, I need you to listen.

It was strange to see dad angry; he was usually so even-keeled. To me, he said, Ronan, Im going to go ahead and lure them out. Stay here and keep a candle lit in case they come this way.

From my pack, I grabbed an Olympic-style torch and ignited it with a lighter tucked in the side compartment. The idea of not having Dad around for protection made my neck hairs stir. If the wooden people attacked, it would come down to me to protect us.

My father said, Remember Mr. McCann, whatever happens, dont let them touch you.

This warning was met with an eyeroll.

Flashlight in hand, Dad disappeared behind a cluster of ash trees while I stood there, knees wobbling.

Thats the trouble with you smalltown folk, Tom said, once the gloom swallowed Dad whole. All these superstitions. This development could be a great opportunity, more tax revenue, more jobs. But instead you run around scared of things going bump in the night.""

Theyre *not* superstitions, I snapped, more forcefully than intended. And besides, even if they were, animals live here too. Are we just gonna wreck *their* homes so you can make some money?

Kid, you see this? He tapped his Rolex. This baby cost 50k. The Aston Martin I arrived in was triple that. Your Dad drives a 3-door hatchback thats older than you are, I heard that shit-heap sputtering up the road five minutes before you appeared. Heres some free advice: if you wanna make something of yourself, pull your head out of the clouds.

At the corner of my eye, a black blob filled the gaps between trees, briefly. After I cleared my throat I said, Money isnt everything.

Sorry to burst your bubble, kid, but it is. Why else would your old man be out here? If he was really set on protecting the forest, why take my money to do this phoney cleansing?

I didnt have an answer for that, so I turned away instead.

Another gust of cold air made me shiver. A moment later, there came a trample of dead leaves.

I choked out a feeble, Dad?

No response.

Is this the part where you stage an attack? Mr. McCann asked, acting bored. But did his voice wobble a little?

Branches stirred as the forest took great, shuddery inhales. It sounded like whispers. The rhythm of my heart quickened.

Its a nice trick, Ill give you that. Tom did a terrible job at sounding disinterested.

More whispers, behind us now. I said a silent prayer Dad arrived back and then whipped my torch and the flashlight around.

Illuminated by the beam, there stood a huge, tumorous oak tree. From behind it, there came a skitter of rapid steps.

I held out the torch like a shield. Whos there?

My companion hung over me like a shadow, so close his short, quick breaths blasted the back of my neck. What happened to all his bravado?

Barely detectable even with the light, the tree inhaled, exhaled. I stood absolutely still, weapon raised and shaking.

See? Mr. McCann stuttered. Its nothing. Just the win

Before he could finish, a pair of eyes opened, cloudy and pale as though stricken by cataracts. Pressed against the tree a face peered back at us, like a mask made from living bark, and smiled.

Together, Mr. McCann and I screamed. My hands fumbled the torch, which slipped into a patch of mud and extinguished with a wet splatter.

The forest erupted into chatter and whispers. Behind us, up ahead, along both sides. I whipped the flashlight in one direction and the next. Anytime the beam landed on a tree there was yet another face, each grinning like a clowder of Cheshire cats.

In unison, figures stepped away from the trunks. From head to toe they were the texture rough bark, except for those pale eyes. Malignant growths engulfed the skulls, twigs and branches sprouted from shoulders and necks, and some were even dappled with furry moss. Limping with crude joints bent at odd angles, they shuffled toward us.

A screaming Mr. McCann tore off through a narrow gap in the undergrowth. I rushed after him, unable to even think straight.

Waist-deep foliage encroached on both sides of the trail, right up to our ankles. I followed the burly man through a maze of sticks and spears as he barrelled ahead, faster than my legs could carry me.

Out of nowhere, he ground to a halt. As I caught up, the terrified man backstepped from *more* wooden people, too many to count. He spun on his heels, knocking me aside as he did, only to discover more closing in from behind, cutting off any hope of escape.

Tom choked out a weak, Please, leave me alone. Ill give you anything. Money. Jewellery. He unclipped is Rolex and offered it as a gift. Ill never come back here. Please&just&

Together, they moved forward, limbs outstretched. They were so close now. So very close.

As Mr. McCanns foot caught on an exposed root, he collapsed backwards into the soil. All our tormenters came to a halt except for one, which continued on until it was close enough to reach out and touch a limb against Toms forehead.

On his hands and knees, he spun away, scrambling toward me across the tangled floor. Already his face had sprouted warts. No, not wartssaplings. Buds. The flesh of his cheeks and forehead bubbled, rapidly swelling in sections, while dark patches grew darker still across his neck, his forearms, his eyes, and even his lips. Paralyzed by fear, I could only watch.

Tears opened up along the sleeves of his tracksuit and ran up the shoulders, across the chest, and down the waist. In a matter of seconds Mr. McCanns limbs became bloated and elongated. His clothes fell to the floor in tattered ruins.

Naked and deformed, he staggered to his feet and shuffled toward me, his screams now fading, his limbs stiff and awkward. Roots sprouted from his feet and grabbed the soil, biting deep, destroying any hope of forward progress. Through unmovable lips, he sputtered, Help me&please. Inside his mouth I saw a thick, green carpet.

Within seconds the man became indistinguishable from a small oak tree, one bough forever reaching forward, the branch lacing inches from my throat.

What broke me out of my trance was the sound of puking. Past the tree that had formerly been Mr. McCann, the wooden person that touched him puked up splinters and moss. Its bark flaked and shed, exposing beige skin underneath. At the end of one limb, a fist opened and closed, revealing a human hand which then tore wood from a skull in huge chunks. Beneath these sections lay human featuresnose, ears, lips. The human flexed and cried and gulped for air, a hatchling emerging from its shell.

I was so entranced by this hideous sight I didnt notice the other wooden people had closed in. After six petrified backsteps, a low branch thicker than an amputated forearm stabbed the small of my lower back. I spun around, heart clawing against my chest, only to discover Id reversed into the nearest wooden person.

I dropped onto the ground, head buried in my lap. Please, I whimpered. I dont want to be one of you. Please.

Even then my thoughts were of Dad, and what he might have thought seeing his son cower in fear like that.

A hush fell over the forest. I took several short, shuddery inhales. That meant my lungs werent solid. Yet.

Slowly, I looked up. Wooden figures loomed over me, motionless. The closest one reeled away its limb.

Let me through. My fathers voice issued from within the crowd.

Dad? I cried.

Figures stepped apart, clearing a path he stepped through. Ronan.

I got up and rushed forward and threw myself into his arms, my cheeks wet with tears. I dropped the torch, Im sorry, Im so

Shush, its okay. He put a warm hand on my shoulder, and my nerves eased.

But Mr. McCann, he

Hes completely fine. Dad stepped aside. Past his shoulder, a *new* Mr. McCann pulled on spare clothes Dad brought in his pack.

A dry gulp seized my throat. We need to run, we need to

Its okay, were not in any danger. He pulled me in close. You see son, theres something you need to know about us. About how I know so much about this place. You and I, Ronan, we were among the first. Years ago, before you were old enough to even remember, our people realized we needed a way to protect ourselves, so I volunteered to go speak with the humans. But they wouldnt listen. So now were pushing back. Against those who want to destroy our home.

Were&were wooden people?

Dad squeezed my hand.

But whatll happen to Mr. McCann?

He gestured toward the tree that was once the real estate mogul. Any hiker who stumbled across it maybe would have made a casual remark about the vaguely human form, the warped portion of bough shaped vaguely like screaming face, forever etched in terror. You could practically hear the silent scream.

Tom McCannthe *new* Tom McCanngrabbed the discarded Rolex from the dirt and brushed it clean. He gave me a little smile and then clasped the watch around his wrist.

I squeezed dads hand even harder. But couldnt we have helped him? We could have explained

He shook his head. If we transformed one hundred Tom McCanns, a hundred more would just pop up. We need to replace them, son. All of them, the humans. Its like I said, the world is bleeding magic. And these flesh bags, they never learn. So, were taking over. Not just here, but everywhere. England, Germany, Spain, America.

He kneeled down, brought himself eye level with me. Are you ready, son? Will you help us protect this world?

I brushed away my tears, a new hardness in my stomach. [I will, Dad. I will.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)",nosleep,1946,1946,0,0.98,4,0,5,55

Chatfield Reservoir, south of Denver, hit capacity a couple of days ago after rising 10 feet in 8 days in the month of May. Last decade, Colorados bipartisan Congressional delegation was united in persistently driving and supporting an effort to expand the reservoir in anticipation of climate change driving up heavy rainfall events. They managed to get major water users to pay for the expansion along with public funding, and the project was completed on time in 2020.

Chatfield Reservoirs expansion was to raise the possible water level by 12 feet. The Army Corps of Engineers said a few days ago that without the expansion, Chatfield State Park would have flooded and been mostly damaged, and the areas around the spillway would have been badly flooded, making some major roads impassable for a long time. So, a science-backed and bipartisan-driven public works effort last decade spared us all the expense of cleaning up a multi-million-dollar major disaster right now, and Im going to take my dog to the off-leash dog park at Chatfield tomorrow like nothing happened.

Edit: A commenter correctly pointed out that the intent of the project was not to mitigate climate change but rather to expand water storage. My original source of information was Army Corps of Engineers information that discussed that this project mitigated an effect of climate change and I incorrectly attributed that that effect was the original intent of the project because that was part of the Army Corps of Engineers basis for approving the expansion project.

Submission statement:

This article from El Pa<ed>s reports on a new study published in Nature that quantifies for the first time the nine thresholds that we shouldn't cross if we want Earth to remain hospitable for civilisation. They include climate change, freshwater availability, natural area conservation, pollution levels, and ozone layer. The study finds that seven of them have already been exceeded in whole or in large areas of the planet. This is a clear sign of collapse, as it shows how human activities are pushing the Earth system beyond its safe and fair limits, threatening the well-being of current and future generations.

Translation:

Seven of the nine thresholds that allow human life on Earth have already been exceeded.

A report quantifies the climatic, natural and pollutant limits that ensure the safe and just maintenance of civilisation.

In 2009, a large group of scientists identified nine limits that humans should not exceed if the Earth is to remain hospitable to civilisation. These included, among others, available fresh water, the natural area that is conserved, pollution levels, the ozone layer and, of course, climate change. Now, a new report just published in Nature quantifies for the first time the thresholds for each of these problems that should not be exceeded if the earth system is to be safe and just not only for present humans, but for future generations. Seven of them have already been exceeded in all or large parts of the planet. The apocalyptic picture is softened by the fact that the hole in the tropospheric ozone layer has fallen off the list: humanity was able to solve the problem in time.

The report identified those limits for the Earth system, understood as a global ecosystem, to be sustainable and safe. It was written at the time that, if they were widely exceeded, a series of catastrophic changes would follow. But since then, safety has been joined by another idea: the Earth system will not be safe if it is not also just. It is one of the contributions of this new report, the quantification of justice between humans, other living beings and future generations.

""Human beings are part of the Earth system. We are a big part of the problem and we have to be a big part of the solution,"" summarises Noelia Zafra, co-author of the report. ""But problems and solutions do not affect everyone equally and there are some humans who bear the inconvenience of sustaining the Earth system, while others mostly benefit. It is also the case that a few generate problems for many,"" adds the researcher from BC3, the Basque climate change research centre.

This is the case, for example, of the emissions that are causing climate change. Their rise dates back to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and the main players, Europe and North America, are the main culprits. Even now, as emerging countries such as China begin to take a greater share of responsibility, half of greenhouse gas emissions come from the richest 10 per cent of the population. ""We cannot act together to tackle the climate and biodiversity crisis if we are not all starting from the same situation and there is conflict between us,"" adds Zafra.

""It's not a goal, it's a limit"".

The 2015 Paris Agreement set an acceptable global average temperature rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius to curb climate change. But that need for fairness explains why the report's authors further lowered the limit on the extra warming the planet could withstand, dropping it to one degree. The director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Change Research (Germany), Johan Rockstr<f6>m, reminded an online press conference that ""1.5 degrees is not a target, it is not a goal, it is a physical limit"". Above that limit the risks are very high, but even before it is exceeded, warming is already having profound consequences. Scientists estimate that the temperature has already risen by an average of 1.2 degrees Celsius and the impact can be felt across most of the planet and suffered by millions of people. 

One of the contributions of this report is that it does not stop at the climate emergency. For its authors, it is already clear that climate change is not the only existential problem facing human civilisation. Another of the thresholds quantified is the portion of the planet that still retains its original state. The work promoted by the Earth Commission, an alliance of leading scientists, set 50-60 per cent of the Earth's surface to be preserved free of livestock, agriculture, mining or any other human interference. ""Currently, we are between 45% and 50%. So, just below the limit,"" recalls David Obura of the organisation CORDIO, and co-author of the study. Obura also points out that denatured areas of the planet can still add resilience to the Earth system. The millions of hectares devoted to pasture and crops - even cities - can be part of the solution, provided that for every square kilometre of altered ecosystem, a minimum of 20 per cent is vegetated, even if it is not natural.

Other thresholds that have been quantified and already exceeded are the extra nutrients contributed to the soil by humans. In particular, they quantify anthropogenic nitrogen and phosphorus used mainly in agriculture. An excess of these elements alters both the substrate and the water in a process known as eutrophication. Cases such as the Mar Menor in Murcia illustrate this very well. The limits not yet exceeded globally, but in large areas of the planet, have to do with the use of water, both surface and groundwater. According to the report, one third of the planet is already over-exploiting surface water resources, with the limit set at 20%. For groundwater, the rate of replenishment is not respected in half of the Earth. As for air pollution caused by the emission of non-natural particles (engine combustion, heating and cooling, industrial emissions, etc.), the limit is still far from being exceeded on a global scale, but it has already been exceeded in several regions of the planet, such as South-East Asia.

The report acknowledges that it leaves out problems such as ocean acidification, plastic accumulation and microplastics, persistent chemicals and antibiotics. They argue that these are threats that have not yet been sufficiently studied to determine whether they pose existential risks. Several of the problems are also related, such as the loss of biodiversity accelerated by excess nutrients. And others, such as climate change, amplify the severity of the others.

""If we look at freshwater, air, pollutants like nitrogen and phosphorus, or the integrity of the biosphere both in terms of surface area and biodiversity, we do so on purpose because if they add up, they provide resilience, buffering capacity and stability to the whole Earth system,"" Rockstr<f6>m told the press conference. Exceeding each threshold in these areas reduces ""the strength of the planet to cope with the climate crisis"". He added: ""Seven of the eight indicators we have been assessing are outside the safe and just space. We also see that there is a window for transformation to regain that safe space that is still possible. But it requires transformations and very, very fast action. And it will not be enough just to decarbonise the global energy system.

How can this be done? From BC3, Zafra recalls the challenge: ""Human well-being cannot exist without the Earth system. Reconciling the well-being of all human beings with justice with the limits of the Earth system means asking ourselves what well-being really is, what and how much we need to feel good, how much we are willing to harm other people and living beings to achieve what, and carrying out broad social processes at all scales that allow inclusive and fair transformations to tackle the climate and biodiversity crisis"".",collapse,1389,1389,0,0.97,0,0,1,149

Theres been a lot of posts about this topic, but I figured Id give a brief rundown of what were going to be dealing with over the next few days. Enemy Number 1: PM2.5

Tomorrow morning (6/8), expect to wake up to very hazy conditions and a red sunrise. The mornings are typically worse, and tomorrow is no exception. It will be the most smoke weve seen thus far from this event. As the day progresses, the smoke will lighten up a bit and overnight looks relatively clear. 

Friday morning (6/9), the smoke returns with a vengeance and holds pretty strong throughout the day. I expect the Air Quality Alert to be extended through Friday at least. 

Saturday (6/10) is a little less clear at this point, but I still expect some level of smoke in the area. The northerly winds are doing us no favors. 

Sunday (6/11) will AGAIN likely start off smoky. However, major relief arrives in the form of a very active, wet weather pattern returning to the Midwest Sunday evening. I expect multiple rounds of rain next week which will bring much needed relief to our air and local flora. The winds will also shift a bit westwardly and start pushing any remaining smoke to the East Coast. 

As for the fires, only time will tell, but its going to be a long summer. This will become a more frequent occurrence in our lifetime. One of the wonderful byproducts of climate change. 

Stay safe out there. Dont be afraid to use your inhaler.

UPDATE as of 9:45 pm on 6/8: as expected, the Air Quality Alert has been extended through Friday night. I do think the smoke will lighten up tomorrow evening and night through Saturday. Theres a chance we are done with Air Quality Alerts for the weekend starting tomorrow night.",Columbus,1304,1304,0,0.96,1,0,0,149

Despite my petite frame, he deemed my clothing promiscuous and often called me derogatory names. Even when my outfits were appropriate, my father would criticize my tops for appearing indecent due to my larger bust. My father continued criticizing my clothing choices, and my mother (45F) remained passive, occasionally adding her agreement to his comments.

While most of this behavior ceased when I turned 18, this night my father burst angrily into my room, shouting, ""Are you a fucking slut?! Do you work at the airport?!"" as he shoved his phone in my face. In the Philippines, the term ""taga airport,"" translated to ""from the airport"" in English, is a derogatory term used to describe sex workers, as many strip clubs are located near airports. When I looked at his phone, I saw that he was referring to my current profile picture on Facebook, which was a mirror selfie of me wearing a string top with a little bit of my cleavage showing.

The photo that my father showed me was a screenshot sent by his brother (60M). It didn't surprise me because he has always been the one to make negative comments about my pics, especially when there is even a slight hint of cleavage visible. He would consistently urge my father to ask me to change such photos.

He was fuming mad and kept spouting things like ""Are you fucking brainless?"", ""Why post this kind of picture?"", and ""What will the other family members say when they see this?"" I was confused at first since the picture was pretty decent and it wasn't anything nude, provocative, nor explicit.

My father insisted that I change my profile picture. I declined, which led to an argument. My mother also insisted that I should delete and change the pic. I told them no, and said that my profile picture was perfectly fine and there was nothing wrong with it. I told them that since it was my account, they had no authority to demand changes. But, my father said that posting such a picture was a ""life-long humiliation"" for him and that he had lost his will to live because of it.

During the argument, a spiteful thought crossed my mind, thus this is where I might be the asshole. I edited my previous picture and added a text overlay that covered my modest display of cleavage, with the word ""censored,"" used it as a profile picture. I accompanied it with a caption saying, ""I hope my entire family is no longer angry since I no longer look like a hooker.""

My relatives on my father's side are blowing me up on our family group chat. And his brother, the one who showed the picture to my father, is telling me to remove my profile picture again. I think I took it too far and should've just changed it with a different picture. So reddit AITA?  


EDIT: sorry guys I got the age mixed up! My father is 65 and my mom is 45, and my uncle is 60. I only focused on my parents' 20 year gap. My older sister is 25 and I'm turning 20 this year.

Also to give more info:  


1. I will move out on August for my Uni which is located in a different city since we will start having face-to-face classes. Yay!
2. My mom does nothing about my father's remarks but trust me, my mom is scarier. She's the type to go physical.
3. My uncle did this before too. One event was when I was wearing a dress for my 18th birthday. The second one is when I changed my profile picture since I was wearing thin strapped dress. And this post is the third one.
4. My father's side of the family is very religious since we have an Aunt who is a nun. My father has around 12 siblings and most of them are single old people who had never been married.
5. When I was younger, my rich Aunt would buy me tons of dresses since she adores me so much. My father got angry about it saying I'm not a barbie doll to be dressed up with clothes like that. 
6. Each time I am objectified sexually, my father would hold me responsible for it, claiming that my choice of clothing is the cause. However, I believe my attire is quite modest. The truth is, my physical features, such as my large bust, buttocks, wide hips, thick thighs, small waist, short height, and pale skin, naturally attract attention in our community where pale skin is highly desired. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that my body type should not be a justification for sexual objectification.
7. Idk if this is also relevant, but when I was conceived, my mother tried to abort me using pills, but it did not work. And my father would say this to me as a joke often. I know it's the truth since my mom never denied it and just avoided the topic.
8. I was raised by a nanny till 10th grade. Growing up, my parents were never really there for me. After being mistreated by them, the next day they would give me money to coax me and would never say sorry.

Ask us your burning questions about using science to predict, prevent, and put out wildfires!","Hi Reddit! We're Ruby Leung, Mark Wigmosta, and Andre Coleman from the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). We're here today to discuss [our scientific approach to tackling wildfires](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/taming-tomorrows-wildfires), an issue that has become increasingly prominent, particularly in the Western United States.

As the wildfire seasons seem to extend and intensify each year, our team and fellow researchers are diligently working on predicting, preventing, and mitigating these disasters. From predicting the occurrence and direction of big blazes to implementing strategies to prevent future fires, our team is leveraging a broad spectrum of scientific perspectives to combat wildfires.

One of our tools, [the RADR-Fire satellite system](https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/rapid-analytics-disaster-response), led by Andre Coleman, helps firefighting personnel, utilities operators, and other decision makers better understand a fire's behavior so they can make informed choices in the midst of natural disaster. It also aids utility operators assess risk by identifying areas prone to wildfire and which energy infrastructure needs protection.

On the preventative side, Mark Wigmosta and team have developed a new tool with the U.S. Forest Service to determine where controlled burns or thinning would be most effective in reducing fire hazards. Such measures have been found to potentially reduce fire hazards by 25-96 percent in certain cases, and also yield benefits like reduced smoke and increased streamflow.

Meanwhile, Ruby Leung is leading a team in creating models that consider an expanded list of ""wildfire predictors,"" delivering a more complete picture of how likely it is that a fire strikes, how far it burns, and how much smoke it releases into the atmosphere.

Our collective work is helping us get an edge on tomorrow's wildfires, making utilities more resilient to natural disasters, and increasing our understanding of fire behavior in response to climate change. We're here today to discuss our research, the scientific principles behind it, and how we see it impacting the future of wildfire management.

We'll be on at **8am pacific (11 AM ET, 15 UT)**, ask us anything!

**Megathread Summary:** 

Multiple wildfires are currently burning across Canada and the resulting smoke is impacting the East Coast of North America which has historically been less impacted by what is normally considered more of a West Coast Problem. 

People are being forced from their homes in multiple areas of Canada while simultaneously others are being told to stay indoors as the air quality outdoors is hazardous to their health. Over 80 Million people are currently under air quality alerts. 

Air Quality Issues are projected to linger all the way into the upcoming weekend. 

Please monitor your local government for up-to-date information.

One rule for me and another for thee.,"Last year there was a continent-wide water shortage and terrible drought. It looks like we are headed for another water shortage this year and I was wondering to myself if golf courses were subject to the same restrictions as us.

""Most business uses are excluded from the temporary use ban. The restrictions are intended to reduce domestic use of water."" 

I learned that golf courses are exempt from this, oddly due to health and safety reasons.

""...they have followed the statutory exemption for golf courses, meaning that, on health and safety grounds, sports turf used for recreation can be watered, but only in play areas.""

That made me really mad, because I maintain a small wildflower meadow for bees and other pollinators and sometimes I need to water newly sown areas or particularly dry areas. What that means is during the drought I will lose a lot of my flowers and garden, which is not just a financial burden but a burden on already struggling wildlife that needs all the help it can get.

Just this year alone I have an approximate 60% less bee activity in my garden (yes it's a rough estimate, but VERY noticeable to me).

This is one example of what grinds my gears beyond belief, that wealthy people are allowed to consume as much public resource with almost no limitations. So if we wanted to change the law we've got to convince people who may be receiving under the table money from millionaires and billionaires who don't want that particular law changed. Yes it sounds like a conspiracy but the word is lobbying and it happens all the time.

""July 2022 was the driest July in [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) since 1935.According to [Sky News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News), in one in seven [counties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_the_United_Kingdom), it was the driest July since records began in 1836 As a result, [hosepipe bans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosepipe_ban) were introduced in some parts of [South East England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_East_England).""

The driest weather in almost 100 years but that won't stop the wealthy from teeing off on soft green grass. To prevent commercial enterprises like golf clubs from using public water, the water board has to apply for a drought order from the Secretary of State (Defra).

They do not proliferate quickly, live very venerably, or evolve rapidly at will. They variously track higher on all of those scales, certainly making them one of the most formidable species among the stars, but none of that is what makes them the most terrifying predators in the known universe.   
  
As humans would put it, the six sensory groups are touch, taste, sight, smell, hearing, and place. There are many many more specific senses of course, but each is a subset of one of those, such as a sense of temperature being part of touch, or the sense of motion being part of place. There is however a seventh sense that all humans possess and only humans possess: Precognition.   
  
Several thousand cycles ago, a ship of the Tlygot was investigating the human home world long before they came to be and found many species of similar build to modern humans proliferating across the planet. They were all variations of the same evolutionary line, but not quite sentient. Seeing potential to corral them into a docile, slave race they collected a few specimens to see which genetic variations had the most desirable traits and began experimenting with the Terran genome.   
  
They wanted a race capable enough to complete nearly any task they might be assigned, but not innately intelligent enough to defy their masters. They removed genetic markers for dangerous traits like claws and fangs, and then crippled their infants to prevent escapees from becoming invasive to the local environments wherever they may be. As fits the Tlygot reputation, it was masterful bioengineering, but there was a single flaw. One of the newly spawned hominids possessed a genetic mutation that seemingly gave them the ability to predict future events. This was not immediately apparent to the Tlygot, and all evidence had been written off simply as savantism. As such, the Tlygot release the first humans to their homeworld to reproduce and eventually become a valuable source of labor amongst the galaxy once theyd reached significant enough numbers to collect.  
  
Following their standard procedure for such ventures, the Tlygot left the world under the eye of an AI meant only to alert them of anything that might spoil their investment. A few hundred cycles later they were alerted that the planet had begun to show signs of civilization which should never have occurred. Assuming another race had missed, or more likely ignored, their claim to the planet, they returned with a small task force of assault craft should they need to deal with them aggressively. Instead they found that their creations had spread across the globe and advanced far faster than even the most intelligent known sentients would have in that time. Still primitive and restricted to simple wood and stone, but a dangerous development nonetheless.   
  
As per galactic treatise, no species may subjugate or enslave another without formal declaration of war, requiring witnesses from at least three non-party races. As an uncontacted race would have no representation, the war could not be approved by the Assembly. This was a problem for the Tlygot because, before bioengineering, the various species of the world had been pre-sentient; therefore outside jurisdiction of the treatise. A clearly sentient species however could not be enslaved, and furthermore, resource rights to the entire local cluster would be lost.  
  
Attempting to hide their mistake before it was made known to the wider galaxy, the Tlygot had their assault craft divert an asteroid to strike the planet in an attempt to wipe the slate clean. The impact caused massive climate change across the biosphere that decimated the populations of all life on the planet, but unexpectedly enough humans survived to not only replenish their numbers, but allow them to advance further still. The Tlygot tried again by setting off a super volcano, and both again, watching the evidence each time they returned and witnessed as the humans somehow managed to predict what decisions would lead to another advancement. Even lacking the Tlygot's own genetic memory traits, they passed their knowledge on to subsequent generations despite the crippling of their young. It was in the young that they found the truth of their mistake.   
  
Lacking the physical ability necessary to survive in any capacity for the first several cycles, the species had adapted to continue development of the brain far beyond infancy. Particularly the enlarged frontal cortex. This has been well documented to be the origin of sentience, or at least its equivalent in other species. All sentient species in the galaxy evolved as predators due to the increased need for the brain to predict the actions of its prey and prepare the appropriate reaction. This would eventually lead to planning and reasoning and the building blocks of sentience. Humans have a frontal cortex so highly developed that what most species would take rotations to calculate and predict, they can often do off handed in moments. While most species could not develop any feasible ranged weapons of war until the development of advanced mathematics, humans could sling stones at avion prey while in motion and predicted where large beasts would flee over long distances, all before they had even invented clothing.   
  
For the Tlygot, the species they had created was beginning to become too expensive to hide and while resetting a biosphere was doable without being noticed on the galactic stage, destroying one would be troubling to say the least; but better to lose a single planet than the entire cluster. The Tlygot with their final attempt decided to crash a comet into the planet's moon on a path that would then in turn cause the moon to collide with the planet. Gravity tugs were dispatched to gradually curve the comet into a collision course to better avoid any unexpected witnesses. As if by cosmic coincidence, the new path accidentally converged with a major hyper lane and an antimatter fuel ship collided with it, destroying both of them along with many more; and slingshotting the situation to the forefront of the galaxy's awareness.  
  
The debacle immediately cost the Tlygot much more than they would have ever lost had they simply openly admitted to everything from the start. The Tlygot were immediately sanctioned and the entire sector of space around the Human homeworld was quarantined while the Galactic Assembly reviewed the records turned over by the Tlygot. The ruling against them for the destruction of the fuel ship and cascading damage to everything within 500 stellar units along the hyperlane was damning. They were forced to inevitably sell themselves into indentured servitude to pay off the debt that could never be repaid.   
  
While the Assembly prioritized matters of blame and repayment, the matter of the fledgling sapients at the center of the events was entirely overlooked. After all, new sapients blinked in and out of existence frequently, and few ever advanced far enough to even be worth contacting. Those that did, took millions of cycles to stumble into electricity let alone any form of communication that could be interpreted into galactic common. They had expected to have ages to come back to the small world, after they settled the financial matters first. The quarantine enacted after the hyperlane disaster had left their corner of the galaxy practically uninhabited and untouched, and with the cloud of antimatter blocking the hyperlane, it stayed that way until the Assembly ordered a proper clean up.   
  
By the time the Tlygots sentence was carried out, the Galactic Assembly found themselves facing an entirely different monster than had ever been expected. The humans had advanced. They had advanced into a thriving interstellar civilization. Not just one civilization either, but several independent states of their own. Their ability to predict possible futures inevitably gave way to the means of creating said futures. While every sentient race was capable of planning and devising new means of accomplishing goals, they did so out of immediate need or convenience. None did so with the foresight of humanity.   
  
The disastrous antimatter explosion that ravaged the hyperlane and facilitated the humans isolation didnt go undetected by them. Their primitive detection systems registered the energy release and caught their attention like lightning to an iron rod. The whole of humanity suddenly became aware that they were not only not alone, but that they had been in the direct path of imminent destruction. They leapt forward into the stars with all their intuition, which they had mistaken for imagination and ingenuity.   
  
They imagined reviving the reassembled dead with lightning and manufactured their medicine into defibrillation and artificial organs. They imagined being able to fly like insects and avians and navigated their means of transit to hypersonic jet propulsion. They imagined statues that could think and function autonomously and fabricated their machinations into robotics and cybernetics. They imagined harnessing the power of stars and delineated the secrets of fusion power. They imagined faster than light travel and illuminated their physics to the warping of space and time. They imagined instantaneous communication and compiled quantum mechanics into the creation of an ansible.   
  
It was the humans who made first contact with the Galactic Assembly, much to the shock of every other sapient race. Humanity had used its time to not only advance to a level of technology almost on par with the Assembly, but had predicted where and how to communicate with them once the cleanup of the hyperlane was underway. As far as the rest of the galaxy was concerned, a new galactic power emerged from the aether overnight. A power that proved proficiency in nearly everything they came in contact with. Anything humans didnt know, they quickly figured out; and anything they couldnt do, they quickly made something to do it for them.   
  
In physical ability they were certainly not the strongest or the fastest, they didnt have the most powerful weapons and armor, and there were ships far larger and more advanced; but all of that counts for little in combat if your opponent knows what you are going to do before you do. Even more so if your opponent is the one who planned for you to do it. Their ability to predict what others might do and what events might unfold was so ingrained in their society that their most simple spawnling games involve divining where their opponents might hide from a predator.   
  
By adolescence most were already so proficient in prediction that they played dozens of advanced simulations that follow various sets of goals and restrictions involving everything from combat and commerce to technological development and social engineering. They even bestowed the title of Grand Master to those so proficient in their clairvoyance that their greatest competition wasnt each other, but advanced artificial intelligences that could calculate every possible move faster than their own minds.  
  
Humans were the most cunning diplomats and merchants because they could guess how far to negotiate before settling any deal. Humans made the best security forces because before danger they always felt their hair stand up. Humans seemingly avoided disasters and created miracles seemingly on a whim based on nothing more than a gut feeling. Humans navigated the ins and outs of societal norms and taboos simply by feeling the vibe. Even works of art or ability they themselves deemed masterful were often attributed to simply being in the zone.  
  
In the span of only a few Human centuries, the new galactic standard of time, humanity had seemingly conquered all of known space simply by existing. They may have been products of the Tlygots less than savory business practices, but even they were freed by their creation as the humans saw no need to enslave what could be just as easily guided to a better future.

After two weeks of surprisingly good results, including one [prohibiting](https://www.npr.org/2023/06/08/1181002182/supreme-court-voting-rights) (obvious) racial gerrymandering and another [upholding](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-native-american-children-adoption-8eee3db1e97cee84a7fdcd98d43df795) the Indian Child Welfare Act, the Supreme Court returned to its regularly scheduled injustice yesterday.

#Innocent but in prison

The first case, Jones v. Hendrix, revolves around a very technical legal issue that essentially boils down to when people held in federal prison can challenge their conviction and/or sentence.

Marcus DeAngelo Jones was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm in 2000 and given a 27-year prison sentence. However, 19 years later, the Supreme Court held that the government must prove that a person knew they had a felony conviction at the time they possessed the gun ([Rehaif v. United States](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-9560_e2p3.pdf)). The decision applied retroactively, which should have allowed Jones to challenge his conviction because he believed that his previous felony conviction had been expunged when he purchased the firearm. According to Rehaif, Jones was innocent.

The method for challenging a federal conviction or sentence, after one exhausts all of their appeals, is called a [Section 2255](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2255) motion. In most cases, incarcerated people can only bring one Section 2255 motion. However, Section 2255 contains several exceptions that allow some federal prisoners to bring a second challenge  one of which allows for a second challenge if Section 2255s usual process is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of detention.

The Supreme Court on Thursday cut off this route of proving ones innocence. For Jones, this means that he cannot challenge his conviction. According to the 6-3 majority, he used his one Section 2255 challenge before Rehaif and is not entitled to another one, even though he could not have known before Rehaif was decided that he had a potentially valid claim that he is innocent.

*To see how this applies to all federal cases, consider that Rehaif corrected a mistake of federal courts, which had been convicting people of a crime (felon in possession of a firearm) without proving an essential element of that crime (knowledge of the previous felony charge). A person who is incarcerated illegally, due to a mistake by the federal courts, now has fewer options to correct the mistake and prove their innocence.*
 
As Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan [wrote](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-857_4357.pdf) in dissent, A prisoner who is actually innocent, imprisoned for conduct that Congress did not criminalize, is forever barred&from raising that claim, merely because he previously sought postconviction relief. It does not matter that an intervening decision of this Court confirms his innocence. By challenging his conviction once before, he forfeited his freedom. 

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, also writing in dissent, took aim at the conservative majoritys [continued hostility](https://theintercept.com/2023/06/17/barry-jones-released-arizona-death-row/) to the imprisonment (and execution) of potentially innocent people:

&gt;Today, the Court holds that an incarcerated individual who has already filed one postconviction petition cannot file another one to assert a previously unavailable claim of statutory innocence. The majority says that result follows from a straightforward reading of 28 U. S. C. <a7>2255. But the majority reaches this preclusion decision by negative inference. And it is far from obvious that <a7>2255(h)s bar on filing second or successive postconviction petitions (with certain notable exceptions) prevents a prisoner who has previously sought postconviction relief from bringing a newly available legal innocence claim in court&

&gt;I am also deeply troubled by the constitutional implications of the nothing-to-see-here approach that the majority takes with respect to the incarceration of potential legal innocents. Apparently, legally innocent or not, Jones must just carry on in prison regardless, since (as the majority reads <a7>2255) no path exists for him to ask a federal judge to consider his innocence assertion. But forever slamming the courtroom doors to a possibly innocent person who has never had a meaningful opportunity to get a new and retroactively applicable claim for release reviewed on the merits raises serious constitutional concerns. 

&gt;I conclude with an observation. Todays ruling follows a recent series of troubling AEDPA interpretations. All of these opinions have now collectively managed to transform a statute that Congress designed to provide for a rational and orderly process of federal postconviction judicial review into an aimless and chaotic exercise in futility. The route to obtaining collateral relief is presently replete with imagined artificial barriers, arbitrary dead ends, and traps for the unwary. And todays turn makes the journey palpably absurd: It begins with the Supreme Courts (rare) announcement that a certain claim for release exists and is retroactively available to incarcerated individuals on collateral review, and ends with the realization that only an arbitrarily determined sliver of eligible prisoners (those who have not had the temerity to file a prior motion) are actually in a position to even ask a court to consider whether any such relief might be provided.

#Navajo water rights

The second case, Arizona v. Navajo Nation, involves the water rights of the 170,000 people who live on the Navajo Nation reservation in the southwest U.S.

The Navajo went to the federal courts in 2003 seeking an assessment of the tribes water needs and a plan to meet them. Roughly one-third of people who live on the reservation do not have running water in their homes. Part of the problem is infrastructure, but a significant factor is who has a right to the regions dwindling water supply in the first place. The 27,000 square miles of reservation land in Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico is arid and plagued by drought, in part caused by the overconsumption of Colorado River basin water (used mostly for [agriculture](https://feedingourselvesthirsty.ceres.org/regional-analysis/colorado-river)) and exacerbated by climate change. 

According to the Navajo, the 1868 [Treaty of Bosque Redondo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Bosque_Redondo)named after the reservation that the Navajo were forcibly relocated toestablished the area as the tribes permanent home and guaranteed the Nation enough water to maintain its land. This isnt a radical interpretation; according to the [Winters doctrine](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL32198.html) (Winters v. United States (1908)), when Congress reserves land (i.e. for an Indian reservation), Congress also reserves water sufficient to fulfill the purpose of the reservation. The question at hand, though, is what reserving water for the Nation entails.

A conservative majority of the Supreme Court, made up of Justices John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito, [ruled](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1484_aplc.pdf) that the Navajo have a right to access water, but the federal government does not need to take active steps to secure that access for the Navajo. 

Justice Kavanaugh, writing for the majority:

&gt;The Navajos claim is not that the United States has interfered with their water access. Instead, the Navajos contend that the treaty requires the United States to take affirmative steps to secure water for the Navajosfor example, by assessing the Tribes water needs, developing a plan to secure the needed water, and potentially building
pipelines, pumps, wells, or other water infrastructure either to facilitate better access to water on the reservation or to transport off-reservation water onto the reservation.
In light of the treatys text and history, we conclude that the treaty does not require the United States to take those affirmative steps. And it is not the Judiciarys role to rewrite and update this 155-year-old treaty&

&gt;In the Tribes view, the 1868 treaty imposed a duty on the United States to take affirmative steps to secure water for the Navajos. With respect, the Tribe is incorrect. The 1868 treaty set apart a reservation for the use and occupation of the Navajo tribe. But it contained no rights-creating or duty-imposing language that imposed a duty on the United States to take affirmative steps to secure water for the Tribe.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justices Sonya Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, dissented, writing that the Supreme Court should have stood aside and let the case play out:

&gt;Today, the Court rejects a request the Navajo Nation never made. This case is not about compelling the federal government to take affirmative steps to secure water for
the Navajos. Respectfully, the relief the Tribe seeks is far more modest. Everyone agrees the Navajo received enforceable water rights by treaty. Everyone agrees
the United States holds some of those water rights in trust on the Tribes behalf. And everyone agrees the extent of those rights has never been assessed. Adding those pieces together, the Navajo have a simple ask: They want the United States to identify the water rights it holds for them. And if the United States has misappropriated the Navajos water rights, the Tribe asks it to formulate a plan to stop doing so prospectively. Because there is nothing remarkable about any of this, I would affirm the Ninth Circuits judgment and allow the Navajos case to proceed& 

&gt;Where do the Navajo go from here? To date, their efforts to find out what water rights the United States holds for them have produced an experience familiar to any American who has spent time at the Department of Motor Vehicles. The Navajo have waited patiently for someone, anyone, to help them, only to be told (repeatedly) that they have
been standing in the wrong line and must try another. To this day, the United States has never denied that the Navajo may have water rights in the mainstream of the Colorado River (and perhaps elsewhere) that it holds in trust for the Tribe. Instead, the governments constant refrain is that the Navajo can have all they ask for; they just need to go somewhere else and do something else first&As they did at Bosque Redondo, they must again fight for themselves to secure their homeland and all that must necessarily come with it. Perhaps here, as there, some measure of justice will prevail in the end.",Keep_Track,957,957,0,0.98,0,0,0,25

Edit (6/8): just listened to Murphys address of the issue, they do state the fires worsening is a direct effect of climate change. They also said the fires that were in NJ are contained, and the extremely heavy majority of the smoke is coming from Canada. They also stated N95s would be available at Newark Penn, if you want masks. Everyone's at risk, children more so, stay safe.",newjersey,952,952,0,0.8,0,0,0,409

Make your bed first thing in the morning: It starts your day off in a positive note and gives you a sense of accomplishment.	
2. Before sleeping, put your phone in a different room and buy an alarm clock: Easiest way to not check your phone in the morning. If you do check your phone, you start your day being reactive rather than proactive. Preferably, no phone first hour of the day. 
3. No phone last hour of the day: You clear your mind to have a better sleep and you wake up much more refreshed.
4. Turn off phone notifications: This lets your phone work as a tool rather than let it control you. You're on your phone when you want to. If people need something from you, they can call you. 
5. Drink Electrolytes first thing in the morning: Helps you stay properly hydrated throughout the day as it can help retain fluids. I personally use LMNT (not a sponsor).
6. Caffeine after 90 minutes: Adenosine receptors (which promote sleep) are not very active when you wake up and Caffeine works by blocking adenosine receptors. If you wait for 90 minutes, caffeine is more effective at blocking the receptors to keep you alert and you won't experience afternoon crashes.
7. Get sunlight (preferably outside) as soon as you wake up: Viewing light early in the day is the most powerful stimulus for wakefulness and it helps you fall and stay asleep at night (even if it is cloudy). The rule is 10 mins if cloudy, 5 mins if sunny, 20 mins if rainy. Last resort is to get near a window if you cannot get outside. Artificial lights do not work as well.
8. Use dim lights or side lamps in the evening to help with sleep: Unlike in the morning, even a bit of Artificial light (like from your phone) can disrupt your sleep. 
9. Use sleep mask over your eyes: Any light will disturb your sleep.
10. Lower your body temperature at night: You sleep better when your body is at a lower temperature (which is why heavy exercise, which raises body temperature, before sleep, makes it hard to fall asleep). I deliberately open the windows 2 hours before I fall asleep to create a cold climate. 
11. Actually sleep 8 hours a day: To get 8 hours of sleep, you need to be 9 hours in bed. On average, you are awake for 1h during the night (most of the time, you dont even notice it). 
12. If something takes less than 2 minutes, do it.
13. Go to sleep same time every day and wake up same time (including weekends where 1h deviations are ok): Your body will start to wake up and sleep naturally. To stick to this, choose a realistic time. 4 AM is not realistic for me to stick to on weekends because I need to be in bed at around 8PM to get 7-8 hours of sleep. 7 AM works for me as I can be in bed at around 11PM every day including weekends. 
14. Don't eat at least 3 hours prior to bed: Helps you fall and stay asleep.
15. Do hardest tasks first thing in the day: Give your energy to what matters most.
16. Start and end your day with gratitude: Everyone has something to be grateful for. A partner, good health, close friends, interesting hobbies, etc. 
17. If you're overwhelmed, go for a walk.
18. f you're still overwhelmed, put pen to paper: Thinking is unstructured and chaotic, while writing is more systematic and solution oriented.
19. If you're still overwhelmed: Look at the challenges you currently face and compare them to the ones you thought you'd never get over.
20. If you're still overwhelmed: Take 3 deep breaths and make the exhales longer than the inhales. This will reduce your heartrate. 
21. If you're STILL overwhelmed: This too shall pass.
22. Track your spending: Easiest way to not overspend. You can't improve what you can't measure. 
23. Take the stairs instead of the lift
24. Plan the next day before going to bed: To remove decision making fatigue.
25. Prepare next day's clothes the night before: Also to remove decision making fatigue. 
26. Every day, set a 10 minute timer to clean whatever is around you: A clean environment reduces stress.
27. Brush your tongue: Morning breath comes from your tongue not tooth. 
28. Dont skip flossing: Main causes of gum issues. 
29. During work, eat foods that are easily digestible: Your body spends a considerable amount of energy digesting food, which is why you feel sluggish after a big meal. Foods that are easily digestible (which make you hungry again really quickly) are things like fruits &amp; vegetables. 
30. Even better, do work when you're fasted for optimal productivity: While fasting, the energy you'd normally use to digest food is available to be used by the brain.
31. Spend 30 minutes every day alone with your own thoughts: We're bombarded with too many distractions that it's rare nowadays to spend time alone. 
32. Never stay seated for more than an hour.
33. Park as far away from work as possible to get your steps in.
34. Be interested rather than interesting: Stop trying to impress others by talking about yourself, instead, be genuinely interested in others to build rapport. 
35. Avoid arguments, you will lose anyway: If you lost the argument, then you lost. If you win, then your opponent's ego takes a hit, so you lost anyway. 
36. Set a 10 minute timer now to unsubscribe from emails to help you clear your inbox. 
37. Leverage browser extension: YouTube, at least for me, can be my biggest distraction. ""Unhook"" browser extension has been a game changer to remove YouTube recommended videos and avoid me from getting into a rabbit hole. There is an equivalent to whatever Social Media App that distracts you the most. 
38. Tell someone how grateful you are for them: It will feel awkward when you start doing it, but it will become normal. Just put yourself in their shoes, how would you feel if a random friend just messaged you and told you how grateful they are for you? 
39. Ask questions that cause the other person to think: The best way to build rapport is to ask these kind of questions. We spend too much time having small talks.  
40. Posture up: Your aura will be different and you will immediately feel more confident. 
41. 80/20 rule productivity rule: 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts. Make sure to focus on that 20%. If you're a YouTuber, that 20% is making videos. If you're a coder, that 20% is coding. 
42. Control the people you are around and the content you consume: You are the product of the people you're around and the content you consume.
43. Cold Showers work: Taking cold showers has been scientifically proven to increase your Dopamine baseline. The baseline indicates how ""motivated"" you are to do things. This is not just about doing things that are uncomfortable (although that's another valid reason).
44. Take these supplements everyday: Vitamin D (During winter or if you don't get to see the sun a lot), Zinc (for immunity &amp; testosterone), Omega 3 Fish Oil (promotes brain function), Vitamin C (if you get sick a lot), Magnesium Biglycinate (before bed to calm you down and because most of us are magnesium deficient).
45. Notice the color of people's eyes: Easiest way to train yourself to practice eye contact. 
46. Repeat the name out loud when you meet someone: Easiest way to train yourself to remember names.
47. Every time you leave a room take something that doesn't belong there and put it away: When it becomes a habit, your house will stay tidy.
48. Teach what you learn: It will force you to spot gaps in your learnings. 
49. Take up space: This will subconsciously increase your confidence. 
50. Admit when you're wrong: People will respect you.
51. Start with Why: Not the How.
52. Think from the other person's point of view.
53. Listen more than you speak.
54. Listen to hear, not to respond.
55. Do not post anything online that you wouldnt' show to your parents, explain to your child, or have an employer find.
56.  If you're sleepy: Take 3 deep breaths and make the inhales longer than the exhales. This will increase your heartrate and wake you up.
57. Make decisions that the 5 year older version of yourself will be proud.
58. Appreciate people the way they are, not the way you want them to be.
59. Buy experiences not products.
60. Follow your breath to bring you to the present moment.
61. Smile: People smile when they are happy, but they also feel happier when they smile. 
62. Keep your working spaces clean and clear: Helps declutter your brain as well.
63. Delayed Gratifications over instant gratifications.
64. Help someone else: There is always something you can offer.
65. How to stop caring what other people think of us: Realize that we dont care about what we think of other people. Nobody is thinking about you the way you are thinking about you. They're all thinking about themselves.
66. Dont see yourself as a victim of what happens to you, but as someone who's given the opportunity to change and grow.
67. Stop trying to get love, focus on giving love.
68. Stand up for yourself, but without being defensive. 
69. Focus on what you can control.
70. From time to time, spend 20 minutes writing why your partner means so much to you. It's easy to forget that.
71. How to be instantly likable: Get the person to do you a favor. We like people not so much for the good they have done for us but for the good we do for them. Watch my stuff in a cafe is a perfect example. Works with small favors not big one.
72. Make goals public to infer accountability.
73. Eat more slowly to eat less as you allow your body time to digest the food.
74. If you're stuck solving a problem, go for a walk, and try again.
75. Write one important quality your partner has, and explain why it's important.
76. For important decisions, trust your gut. For minor decisions, weigh the pros &amp; cons.
77. Praise people (especially children) for their effort not their ability.
78. Dont rush in giving advice. 
79. The One Thing: For maximum productivity, ask yourself: What is that one thing that if I accomplish today, will get me closer towards my goals?
80. Deal with emails at the end of your day and use your prime hours to work on that One Thing.
81. To reduce social media usage: If you buy a new phone, don't sell the old one. Keep social media, games, and all distracting apps there and make your new phone distraction free. Go out only with your new phone.
82. Take long hot showers at night to help you sleep better and to give yourself time to think creatively. Shower thoughts are real.
83. Dont shop your groceries when you're hungry.
84. Spending time in nature makes you calmer.
85. Leave your headphones at home: Give your brain room to think and be quiet. We're so used to consuming, not reflecting. Stop consuming other people's thoughts and start consuming your own.
86. Tonality &amp; Body Language are key to charisma.
87. Do more than what you're paid for: Assuming you want to progress your career.
88. Take 3 deep breaths before an event that makes you anxious: Like talking to the opposite sex, an interview, etc. Exhales longer than an inhale. 
89. If you're nervous before an important event like a speech or an interview. Tell yourself that you're excited, not nervous. Excitement and Nervousness are psychologically the same. 
90. Practice saying no and prioritize yourself.
91. When you take a break, do things that dont require a lot of thinking like walking, doing laundry, and dont stimulate yourself with pleasures (especially your phone). 
92. Make time (5 minutes) in the afternoon to reflect on how your day is going. A lot of times, we get too sucked in and zooming out in the middle of the day can be beneficial. 
93. Explore new things to enhance creativity: Try a different coffeeshop today, a different movie genre, etc.
94. Dont hit the snooze button.
95. Take care of your skin: For the majority of us; moisturizer twice a day (use different ones for AM &amp; PM), cleanser twice a day, and exfoliation 3 times a week. Pick any highly reviewed product from these categories.
96. For those struggling to drink more water: Buy one of those water bottles with straws inside them. It makes the habit of drinking water more automatic as you dont have to lift your head up to drink water. 
97. Spend time with your family. Not everyone has that luxury.
98. If you're anxious, ask yourself, what is the worst that can happen?
99. Every night, ask yourself: What are the things you did well today and what are the things you can improve. 
100. Capture what you learn: Your brain can only hold so much information. If any of what I wrote resonated with you, note them down because otherwise, you'll most likely forget about them. Bookmark reddit posts, Save YouTube Videos, etc.",selfimprovement,874,874,0,0.97,1,0,2,57

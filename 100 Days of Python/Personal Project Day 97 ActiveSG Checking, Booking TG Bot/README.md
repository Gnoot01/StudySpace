Inspired to create this after hearing my sister's struggles of booking a gym slot, especially for the more popular gyms.

Also ActiveSG website is horribly hard to navigate (inconsistent nav bars, menu-dropdown presenting non-fruitful results for some reason)

OMG I managed to deploy to Heroku - everyone saying pythonanywhere easier etc etc but man couldn't figure out where to start

Massive kudos to this [GOAT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfdNIOYGYVI)

Learning points, and necessary changes to deploy on Heroku on my deploy_aktivesgbot repo

Originally didn't know how to deploy/if can deploy non-web apps. But felt a bit sad people don't get to use it, so I tried anyway.

And I'm so glad I tried! :D :D :D :D

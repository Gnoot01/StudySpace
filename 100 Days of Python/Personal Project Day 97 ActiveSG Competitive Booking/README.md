This is a simple working prototype of booking 'competitively' at 9am each day 3 days in advance for the gym slot on ActiveSG, which gets snatched up in minutes 
(esp so for the more popular timings like 9am, 11am, 5pm, 7pm, etc).

ActiveSG utilizes Google recaptchav2, which enables users to pass the captcha just by clicking on it. Looks at how you behaved prior to clicking eg. 
how your cursor moved on its way to the check (organic path/acceleration), which part of the checkbox was clicked (random places, or dead on center every time using 
click location history tied to your acc), browser fingerprint, Google cookies & contents
